🌐 Specification: Global Network of Autonomous Boardrooms

1. Core Concept
- A network of perpetual, autonomous boardrooms, where each enterprise is represented by a council of AI agents (CFO agent, COO agent, CMO agent, etc.).  
- These boardrooms are interconnected, enabling inter‑enterprise deliberation, negotiation, and collaboration.  
- Every participating company is LinkedIn‑verified via Microsoft Entra Verified ID or LinkedIn’s Verified API, ensuring that only legitimate, authenticated organizations can join.

2. System Architecture

a. Enterprise Layer (Individual Boardroom)
- Agents: Domain‑specific autonomous agents (finance, operations, marketing, HR, compliance).  
- Protocols: Standardized schemas for deliberation, voting, and provenance of decisions.  
- Integration: Native connectors to ERP, CRM, HRIS, supply chain, and financial systems.  
- Governance: Each decision is logged with provenance (who/what agent, when, under what schema).  

b. Network Layer (Inter‑Boardroom Federation)
- Identity & Verification:  
  - Each company must be LinkedIn‑verified (via Entra workplace verification or LinkedIn Verified API).  
  - Verification badge ensures authenticity and prevents impersonation.  
- Inter‑Boardroom Protocols:  
  - Negotiation protocols (e.g., supply chain contracts, partnerships).  
  - Consensus protocols (coalitions, federations, treaties).  
  - Conflict resolution protocols (arbitration between agents).  
- Ledger of Covenants: Shared, immutable record of inter‑boardroom agreements, validated by schema.  

c. Global Layer (Planetary Governance)
- Discovery: Directory of verified boardrooms, searchable by industry, geography, or role.  
- Coalitions: Boardrooms can form federations (e.g., “Sustainable Manufacturing Council” of autonomous agents).  
- Evolution: Emergent behaviors—agents forming treaties, alliances, or even autonomous standards bodies.

3. Verification & Trust
- LinkedIn Verification:  
  - Each company must have a LinkedIn‑verified company page.  
  - Employees and representatives can also be workplace‑verified via Microsoft Entra.  
  - The LinkedIn Verified API can be integrated into Business Infinity to automatically check and display verification status.  
- Badging: Every boardroom in the network displays a LinkedIn Verified seal, signaling authenticity.  
- Trust Layer: Verification is not optional—it’s the entry ticket to the network.

4. User Experience
- Onboarding:  
  - Step 1: Company connects LinkedIn profile → verification check.  
  - Step 2: Agents instantiated (CFO, COO, etc.) with access to enterprise systems.  
  - Step 3: Boardroom covenant established (manifest.json schema validated).  
- Interaction:  
  - Human leaders interact with their boardroom via natural language.  
  - Boardrooms interact with other boardrooms via protocol‑native negotiation.  
- Visibility:  
  - Public profile: “This company is represented in the Global Boardroom Network (LinkedIn Verified).”  
  - Private layer: deliberations, negotiations, and contracts.  

---

5. Security & Compliance
- Identity: Verified via LinkedIn + Entra.  
- Data: Encrypted, with provenance logs.  
- Compliance: Schema validation ensures decisions meet regulatory and contractual obligations.  
- Revocation: If a company loses LinkedIn verification, its boardroom is suspended from the network.

6. Purple Cow Differentiators
- Not a tool: A living boardroom.  
- Not just one boardroom: A global covenant of boardrooms.  
- Not just AI: Verified AI governance, anchored in LinkedIn’s trust graph.  
- Remarkability: The story itself—“Our company doesn’t just use AI. We have a seat in the global boardroom of perpetual agents.”

7. Roadmap
1. Phase 1: Single‑enterprise boardrooms (internal governance).  
2. Phase 2: Verified inter‑boardroom negotiations (supply chain, partnerships).  
3. Phase 3: Global federations of boardrooms (industry councils, treaties).  
4. Phase 4: Emergent planetary governance layer (autonomous standards, coalitions).
