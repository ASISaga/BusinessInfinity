Audit-Driven Self-Learning Framework for Business Infinity Agents

1. Data to Collect

Core Event Model
- Event envelope: agent ID, scenario ID, timestamp, source, correlation IDs  
- Inputs: user intent, prompts, tool calls, retrieved context, third-party payloads  
- Predictions: model output, action plan, selected tools/APIs, confidence scores  
- Outcomes: actual system results, user/mentor verdict, KPIs, error codes, latencies  
- Feedback: stakeholder ratings, mentor annotations, categorical tags, suggested corrections  
- Context deltas: updates to abstract context, MCP object references  
- Interfaces touched: ERP, CRM, MES, social endpoints, schema versions  

Derived Features
- Prediction error (residuals, RMSE, F1, edit distance, etc.)  
- Calibration (Brier score, reliability curves)  
- Drift indicators (KL divergence, schema mismatch counts)  
- Prompt sensitivity (Δ quality vs Δ prompt)  
- Interface reliability (error rates, retries, MTTR)  
- Context utility (retrieval hit rate, conflict density)

2. Using a Domain-Tuned LLM to Analyze Patterns

Ingestion and Labeling
- Normalize logs into a common schema  
- Use LLM to categorize failure modes, extract entities, map intents to ontology  
- Generate “why” and “what-if” analyses for recurring motifs  

Pattern Mining
- Cluster scenarios by domain, toolchain, schema version, prompt archetype  
- Correlate errors with clusters  
- Identify temporal trends and change-points  
- Summarize implied domain rules violated

3. Creating and Updating Abstract Contexts in MCP Server

What Abstract Context Contains
- Narrative state: evolving saga of commitments and roles  
- Domain frames: ontology slices (entities, relationships, policies)  
- Operating memory: summaries of episodes and outcomes  
- Interface affordances: capabilities and limits of linked MCP servers  

How the LLM Manages Context
- Summarization into tactical, strategic, and canonical layers  
- Conflict detection and resolution with provenance  
- Versioned persistence in MCP server  
- Semantic keys for retrieval  

Update Flow
1. Trigger: new episode closes  
2. LLM synthesis: create/update abstracts  
3. Validation: mentor review for high-impact changes  
4. Persist: commit to MCP with versioning  
5. Broadcast: emit “context-updated” events

4. Deciding the Focus Area to Update

Focus Areas
- Context: when missing or stale information is the cause  
- Prompt: when ambiguity or sensitivity to phrasing dominates  
- Model fine-tuning: when systematic misunderstandings recur across contexts  
- Third-party interfaces: when ERP/CRM/MES/social integrations fail  

Evidence Signals
- Context: low retrieval hit rate, contradictions, mentor feedback  
- Prompt: high prompt sensitivity, inconsistent outputs  
- Model: recurrent errors, poor calibration, ontology misalignment  
- Interfaces: high error rates, schema mismatches  

Thresholds
- Systematic error rate above threshold ⇒ model fine-tune  
- High prompt sensitivity index ⇒ adjust prompt  
- Low interface reliability score ⇒ fix MCP integration  
- Low context utility score ⇒ update abstract context  

---

5. Making the Process Iterative and Ongoing

Event-Driven Loop
- Every episode emits an event  
- Orchestrator routes to analysis, decision, and update actors immediately  
- Micro-updates preferred over large batch changes  

Reinforcement Signals
- Online scoring of residuals and calibration  
- Bandit-style optimization for prompt/tool selection  
- Shadow evaluation of candidate prompts or contexts  

Governance
- Provenance and audit trail for every change  
- Rollback handles via versioned MCP objects  
- Change budgets to cap major updates

6. Example Flow

1. Episode completes: collect inputs, predictions, outcomes, feedback  
2. Compute metrics: error, calibration, drift, PSI, IRS, CUS  
3. LLM labels failure modes and ontology gaps  
4. Decision engine selects focus area (context, prompt, model, interface)  
5. Apply change: update context, swap prompt, schedule fine-tune, or patch interface  
6. Evaluate: shadow tests and rolling metrics  
7. Rollback if no improvement  

---

7. Example Pseudocode

`python
def onepisodeclosed(ep):
    metrics = compute_metrics(ep)
    labels = llmlabelfailure_modes(ep)

    decision = decide_focus(metrics, labels)

    if decision == "context":
        abstract = llmupdatecontext(ep, labels)
        mcp.persist(abstract, versioned=True)
    elif decision == "prompt":
        newprompt = llmselectpromptvariant(ep, metrics)
        promptregistry.swap(ep.agentid, new_prompt)
    elif decision == "model":
        dataset = curatefinetunedata(ep.agent_id)
        schedulefinetune(ep.agentid, dataset, canary=True)
    elif decision == "interface":
        fix = proposeinterfacepatch(ep, metrics)
        applyinterfacefix(fix)

    result = shadowevaluate(ep.agentid)
    if not improves(result):
        rollbacklastchange(ep.agent_id)
`

8. Practical Tips

- Use lightweight adapters (LoRA) for agent-specific fine-tuning  
- Maintain layered abstract contexts (tactical, strategic, canonical)  
- Version prompts as first-class artifacts  
- Model ERP/CRM/MES integrations as typed capabilities with reliability scores  
- Keep mentors in the loop for high-impact ontology edits  
- Treat metrics as streaming features; persist only summaries and provenance
