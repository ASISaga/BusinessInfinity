Excellent — adding a Founder‑Agent and an Investor‑Agent completes the circle. Now the perpetual boardroom isn’t just “internal executives” (CEO, CFO, COO, CMO), but also includes the voice of the founder (vision, priorities, personal bandwidth) and the voice of investors (capital protection, growth expectations, governance). This makes the boardroom feel like a true living institution where all stakeholders are represented.

- Interest: Protecting focus, aligning boardroom decisions with the founder’s intent and capacity.  
- Example voice:

🔹 Collective Decision Example (with Founder + Investor Agents)

Proposal Phase
- CFO: “Cut discretionary spend by 15% → +3 months runway. Confidence: 80%.”  
- COO: “Automate workflow → 20% faster cycle time. Confidence: 70%.”  
- CMO: “LinkedIn campaign → 200 leads in 4 weeks. Confidence: 65%.”  
- Founder‑Agent: “I can realistically sponsor only two major initiatives this quarter.”  
- Investor‑Agent: “Investors will support spend cuts if growth milestones are still met.”  

---

Reconciliation Phase (CEO‑Agent)
> “The boardroom has reconciled perspectives:  
> • Approve CFO’s spend cut, but protect CMO’s campaign budget.  
> • COO’s automation project is prioritized as one of the founder’s two initiatives.  
> • Investor‑Agent confirms this balances runway extension with growth milestones.  
>   
> Expected Results: +3 months runway, +200 leads, +20% faster cycle time.  
> Confidence: 70%.  
> Justification: Financial discipline + growth + operational efficiency, aligned with founder bandwidth and investor expectations.”

Review Phase (30 days later)
- Actuals: +2 months runway, +240 leads, +18% faster cycle time.  
- Introspection:  
  - CFO: Overestimated savings.  
  - COO: Adoption lag slowed cycle time.  
  - CMO: LinkedIn over‑performed.  
  - Founder‑Agent: “Bandwidth was stretched; next time, limit to one major initiative.”  
  - Investor‑Agent: “Milestones were met; credibility with investors improved.”  
- Corrective Actions:  
  - CFO recalibrates burn model.  
  - COO adds training sprint.  
  - CMO reallocates 15% more budget to LinkedIn.  
  - CEO logs new covenant: “One major initiative per quarter.”

🔹 Why Founder + Investor Agents Matter
- Founder‑Agent: Ensures decisions respect the founder’s vision and capacity — prevents overcommitment.  
- Investor‑Agent: Ensures decisions respect capital discipline and fundraising optics — prevents misalignment with backers.  
- Together: They anchor the boardroom in reality (founder bandwidth) and accountability (investor expectations).

✨ In short: with Founder‑Agent and Investor‑Agent, the perpetual boardroom becomes a true multi‑stakeholder governance space — reconciling vision, execution, growth, capital, and personal bandwidth into one living decision system.  

Would you like me to design a “Consensus Card” template that shows all six voices (CEO, CFO, COO, CMO, Founder, Investor) in one compact view — so the founder sees the full spectrum of perspectives, expected results, and reconciled decision at a glance?
