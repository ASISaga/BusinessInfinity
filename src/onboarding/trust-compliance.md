# Business Infinity – Specifications

This document defines the **application-level responsibilities** for Business Infinity, built on Microsoft Azure’s compliant infrastructure.  
While Azure provides the certified foundation (ISO, SOC, GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.), Business Infinity is responsible for **application-level trust, governance, and operations**.

---

## 1. Identity & Access Setup

- **Onboarding Flow**
  - If customer already has an Azure (Entra ID) identity → federate it.
  - If not → provision a new identity at onboarding.
- **Access Control**
  - Assign each identity to a customer-specific partition in Azure Tables.
  - Enforce **least privilege**: users can only access their own data.
- **Admin Roles**
  - Define clear role taxonomy (Admin, Operator, Customer).
  - Admins can be restricted from customer data if required.

---

## 2. Data Segregation & Governance

- **Partition Strategy**
  - Use **PartitionKey** in Azure Tables to isolate each customer’s data.
  - Ensure schema validation prevents cross-customer leakage.
- **Ownership Model**
  - Document: “Customer X owns Partition X.”
- **Governance**
  - Maintain a manifest of customer-to-partition mappings.
  - Automate validation checks to prevent drift.

---

## 3. Application-Level Compliance

- **Privacy Policy**
  - Publish a clear statement on how Business Infinity leverages Azure’s compliance.
- **Audit Logging**
  - Track all access events (who, what, when).
  - Store logs securely for compliance audits.
- **Data Lifecycle**
  - Define retention and deletion policies.
  - Ensure customer data can be exported or purged on request.

---

## 4. Security Controls

- **Identity Security**
  - Enforce MFA for all admin accounts.
  - Use strong password policies for customers.
- **Monitoring**
  - Enable Azure Monitor and Storage Analytics.
  - Set alerts for unusual access patterns.
- **Future Enhancements**
  - Conditional Access (premium feature) for scaling scenarios.

---

## 5. Customer Trust Layer

- **Transparency**
  - Publish a “Trust & Compliance” page on the website.
- **Self-Service**
  - Customers log in with their Azure identity to access only their data.
- **Support**
  - Provide workflows for data export (“Show me my data”).
  - Ensure only customer-specific partitions are shared.

---

## 6. Operational Readiness

- **Onboarding Runbook**
  - Step-by-step guide for provisioning new customers.
- **Incident Response**
  - Define escalation paths for breaches or misconfigurations.
- **Contributor Roles**
  - Formalize role taxonomy:
    - Infra Maintainers
    - App Developers
    - Customer Success
- **Training**
  - Educate contributors on schema validation, role boundaries, and compliance responsibilities.
