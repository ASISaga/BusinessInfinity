# Business Infinity — Blueprint Evolution Framework

## Purpose
Define how Business Infinity evolves **all core specifications** — including **domain‑tuned LLMs**, **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**, and **the agents themselves** — using LLM scoring as the evaluation engine, ensuring every change accelerates fulfilment of the company’s possibility (vision).

## 1. Scope of Evolvable Blueprints

### A. Intelligence Layer
- **Domain‑Tuned LLMs**
  - Fine‑tuned weights and domain lexicons
  - Scoring criteria and weighting logic
  - Reasoning chain patterns (multi‑step, deliberative, etc.)
  - Vision & Purpose embeddings

### B. Context Orchestration Layer
- **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**
  - Context window design (what’s in scope for the model at any moment)
  - Context refresh cadence and triggers
  - Cross‑agent context exchange rules
  - Provenance and traceability of context slices
  - Guardrails for context injection (compliance, sensitivity)
  - Federation rules for context sharing across organisations

### C. Agent Layer
- **Agent Blueprints**
  - Role definitions (e.g., CEO‑Agent, COO‑Agent, CMO‑Agent)
  - Decision domains and authority levels
  - Collaboration archetype participation
  - Scoring weight profiles for different decision types
  - Autonomy phase progression rules
  - Internal reasoning style (e.g., consensus‑seeking, risk‑averse, exploratory)
  - Escalation and delegation protocols

### D. Decision & Governance Layer
- Artifact Specifications
- Governance Policies
- Collaboration Archetypes
- IXL Mode Specs
- Macro Journey Definitions

## 2. Triggers for Evolution
- **Performance Signals:** KPI trends, resilience indices, opportunity capture rates
- **Evaluation Signals:**  
  - LLM scoring patterns showing low Vision Alignment or Domain Fit for certain decision types
  - Context loss or drift detected in MCP logs
  - Agent performance variance (e.g., frequent overrides, slow consensus)
- **Context Signals:** New regulatory, market, or ecosystem conditions
- **Pattern Signals:** Emergence of new collaboration or decision patterns

---

## 3. LLM Scoring as the Evaluation Engine
- **Source:** Domain‑tuned LLMs fine‑trained with:
  - The company’s *possibility (vision)*
  - Domain‑specific operational knowledge
- **Scoring Dimensions:**
  1. Vision Alignment
  2. Purpose Alignment
  3. Legendary Lens
  4. Domain Fit
  5. Resilience Potential
- **Application:**
  - **Operational Decisions:** Score options in `DecisionTree.v1`
  - **Blueprint Evolution:** Score proposed spec versions (including LLM, MCP, and Agent changes) as meta‑options in a Blueprint DecisionTree

---

## 4. Evolution Lifecycle (Including LLMs, MCPs & Agents)

1. **Detection & Logging**
   - Trigger identified (performance, evaluation, context, pattern)
   - `ProvenanceReceipt.v1` links trigger to affected blueprint(s)

2. **Review & Diagnosis**
   - Boardroom session with relevant role agents and technical stewards
   - Current blueprint loaded with related LLM scoring history, MCP context logs, and agent performance analytics

3. **Drafting Proposed Changes**
   - New `.vX` blueprint version created (e.g., `COO-Agent.v3`, `Organizational-Data-MCP.v4`, `CEO-Agent-LLM.v2`)
   - Treated as an *option* in a Blueprint DecisionTree

4. **LLM Scoring Evaluation**
   - Each option scored by domain‑tuned LLMs for Vision Alignment, Domain Fit, Resilience Potential
   - Scores recorded in `DecisionScore.v1` (meta‑decision context)

5. **Simulation & Validation**
   - Mentor Mode runs historical and synthetic scenarios with proposed LLM/MCP/Agent changes
   - Compare LLM scores and simulated outcomes

6. **Governance Approval**
   - Governance Dashboard presents LLM scores + simulation results
   - Approval per relevant policy

7. **Deployment & Communication**
   - New blueprint replaces old in active system
   - Change log published with rationale and LLM scorecard

8. **Post‑Deployment Monitoring**
   - Track both KPIs and LLM scoring patterns for confirmation

## 5. Example — Evolving an Agent Blueprint
**Trigger:**  
COO‑Agent consistently scores low on Vision Alignment for sustainability‑related supply chain decisions.

**Process:**  
- Review `COO-Agent.md` role definition and scoring weight profile
- Draft v3 with:
  - Increased weighting for ESG metrics in DecisionScore
  - Expanded authority in sustainability‑driven procurement
- LLM scores: v2 = 0.69 Vision Alignment, v3 = 0.88
- Simulate in Mentor Mode with past supply chain scenarios
- Governance approves; deploy and monitor

---

## 6. Example — Evolving an MCP Blueprint
**Trigger:**  
Context drift in cross‑org decision loops causing misaligned scoring.

**Process:**  
- Review `ValueChain-MCP.md` context refresh rules
- Draft v3 with:
  - More frequent context refresh for high‑urgency events
  - Expanded shared artifact set for federated decisions
- LLM scores: v2 = 0.72 Vision Alignment, v3 = 0.90
- Simulate in Mentor Mode with past federated crisis scenarios
- Governance approves; deploy and monitor

## Design Principle
In Business Infinity, **agents, LLMs, and Model Context Protocols are all evolvable**.  
The system’s intelligence is not just in *what* it knows, but in *who* acts, *how* they reason, and *how* they are contextualised — and all three are continuously re‑engineered, guided by LLM scoring against the company’s vision.
