# Business Infinity — Agent, LLM & MCP Evolution Blueprint

## Purpose
Define how Business Infinity evolves **agents**, **domain‑tuned LLMs**, and **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)** using clearly defined operational triggers and **LLM scoring** as the evaluation engine.  
Every change must accelerate fulfilment of the company’s possibility (vision).

## 1. Scope of Evolvable Blueprints

### A. Agent Layer
- Role definitions (e.g., CEO‑Agent, COO‑Agent, CMO‑Agent)
- Decision domains and authority levels
- Collaboration archetype participation
- Scoring weight profiles for different decision types
- Autonomy phase progression rules
- Internal reasoning style (consensus‑seeking, risk‑averse, exploratory)
- Escalation and delegation protocols

### B. Intelligence Layer
- **Domain‑Tuned LLMs**
  - Fine‑tuned weights and domain lexicons
  - Scoring criteria and weighting logic
  - Reasoning chain patterns
  - Vision & Purpose embeddings

### C. Context Orchestration Layer
- **Model Context Protocols (MCPs)**
  - Context window design
  - Context refresh cadence and triggers
  - Cross‑agent context exchange rules
  - Provenance and traceability of context slices
  - Guardrails for context injection
  - Federation rules for context sharing

### D. Decision & Governance Layer
- Artifact Specifications
- Governance Policies
- Collaboration Archetypes
- IXL Mode Specs
- Macro Journey Definitions

## 2. Evolution Triggers

1. **Specification Variation**  
   - New decision behaviours or reasoning patterns emerge in an agent due to updated LLM fine‑tuning, altered scoring weights, or new MCP context patterns.

2. **Operational Pressure**  
   - Market shifts, regulatory changes, crises, or competitive moves expose weaknesses in current agent, LLM, or MCP specifications.

3. **Performance Differentiation**  
   - Certain configurations consistently outperform others in Vision Alignment and Domain Fit scores.

4. **Contextual Divergence**  
   - An agent operates in a unique market, regulatory, or cultural context and develops distinct decision logic.

5. **Scheduled Iteration Review**  
   - Periodic meta‑review after a set number of governance cycles to aggregate ImprovementPlans and scoring history.

6. **Step‑Change Event**  
   - Major disruption or opportunity that requires rapid blueprint redesign.

## 3. LLM Scoring as the Evaluation Engine

- **Source:** Domain‑tuned LLMs fine‑trained with:
  - The company’s *possibility (vision)*
  - Domain‑specific operational knowledge
- **Scoring Dimensions:**
  1. Vision Alignment
  2. Purpose Alignment
  3. Legendary Lens
  4. Domain Fit
  5. Resilience Potential
- **Application:**
  - **Operational Decisions:** Score options in `DecisionTree.v1`
  - **Blueprint Evolution:** Score proposed spec versions (Agent, LLM, MCP) as meta‑options in a Blueprint DecisionTree

---

## 4. Evolution Lifecycle

1. **Detection & Logging**
   - Trigger identified (variation, pressure, differentiation, divergence, iteration, step‑change)
   - `ProvenanceReceipt.v1` links trigger to affected blueprint(s)

2. **Review & Diagnosis**
   - Boardroom session with relevant role agents and technical stewards
   - Current blueprint loaded with LLM scoring history, MCP context logs, and agent performance analytics

3. **Drafting Proposed Changes**
   - New `.vX` blueprint version created (e.g., `COO-Agent.v3`, `Organizational-Data-MCP.v4`)
   - Treated as an *option* in a Blueprint DecisionTree

4. **LLM Scoring Evaluation**
   - Each option scored for Vision Alignment, Domain Fit, Resilience Potential
   - Scores recorded in `DecisionScore.v1` (meta‑decision context)

5. **Simulation & Validation**
   - Mentor Mode runs historical and synthetic scenarios with proposed changes
   - Compare LLM scores and simulated outcomes

6. **Governance Approval**
   - Governance Dashboard presents LLM scores + simulation results
   - Approval per relevant policy

7. **Deployment & Communication**
   - New blueprint replaces old in active system
   - Change log published with rationale and LLM scorecard

8. **Post‑Deployment Monitoring**
   - Track KPIs and LLM scoring patterns for confirmation

## 5. Example — Evolving an Agent Blueprint
**Trigger:**  
Operational Pressure + Performance Differentiation — COO‑Agent underperforms in sustainability decisions; another variant excels.

**Process:**  
- Review `COO-Agent.md` role definition and scoring weights
- Draft v3 with increased ESG weighting and expanded sustainability authority
- LLM scores: v2 = 0.69 Vision Alignment, v3 = 0.88
- Simulate in Mentor Mode with past supply chain scenarios
- Governance approves; deploy and monitor

---

## 6. Example — Evolving an MCP Blueprint
**Trigger:**  
Contextual Divergence — Federated partner’s MCP context rules diverge due to unique regulatory environment.

**Process:**  
- Review `ValueChain-MCP.md` context exchange rules
- Draft v3 with region‑specific context filters and refresh cadence
- LLM scores: v2 = 0.75 Vision Alignment, v3 = 0.91
- Simulate in Mentor Mode with past cross‑org decisions
- Governance approves; deploy and monitor

## Design Principle
In Business Infinity, **agents, LLMs, and Model Context Protocols are all evolvable**.  
The system’s intelligence is not just in *what* it knows, but in *who* acts, *how* they reason, and *how* they are contextualised — and all three are continuously re‑engineered, guided by LLM scoring against the company’s vision.
