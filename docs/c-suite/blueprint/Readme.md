# AI C‑Suite & Federated Collaboration Framework

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the complete, modular specification set for designing, deploying, and governing **AI‑driven executive councils** (C‑suite agents) within a single company and across a federated supply/value chain.

It includes:
- **Static architecture** — roles, archetypes, artifacts, governance.
- **Dynamic behaviour** — event flows, decision loops, learning cycles.
- **Scenario playbook** — real‑world examples of the system in action.
- **Traceability matrix** — mapping scenarios to artifacts, UI modules, and governance.

## 3. How to Use This Repository

### Single Company
1. Implement **Core Architecture**.
2. Instantiate **Role Blueprints**.
3. Deploy **MCP‑UI (SingleCompany)**.
4. Roll out **Progressive Autonomy**.

### Federated / Value Chain
1. Establish **Local Councils**.
2. Adopt **Federated Network Spec**.
3. Select **Collaboration Archetypes**.
4. Deploy **MCP‑UI (ValueChain)**.
5. Roll out **Progressive Autonomy Federated**.

## 4. Dynamics in Action

The **Dynamic Scenarios Playbook** shows how the system behaves in real‑world contexts:
- Supply Chain Disruption
- Joint Product Launch
- Regulatory Change
- Internal Innovation Sprint
- Crisis Response Drill

---

## 5. Scenario Traceability Matrix

The **Scenario Traceability Matrix** maps each scenario to:
- **Artifacts** created, updated, or consumed.
- **MCP‑UI modules** where those artifacts appear.
- **Governance policies** applied.

| Scenario | Key Artifacts | UI Modules | Governance |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Supply Chain Disruption | SharedEvent, SharedForecast, DecisionTree, DecisionScore, JointGovernanceDecision, ProvenanceReceipt, JointPerformanceReport, ImprovementPlan | Ecosystem Dashboard, Multi‑Company Artifact Library, Decision Workspace, Joint Decision Room, Execution Console, Governance Panel | MultiPartyDecisionPolicy, tier‑scoped access, human‑in‑loop for contracts |
| Joint Product Launch | SharedEvent, CampaignCalendar, PartnershipAgreement, DecisionTree, DecisionScore, GovernanceDecision, ProvenanceReceipt, JointPerformanceReport, ImprovementPlan | Ecosystem Dashboard, Artifact Browser, Decision Workspace, Joint Decision Room, Execution Console, Governance Panel | InterOrgDecisionPolicy, marketing‑role scoped access |
| Regulatory Change | SharedEvent, RegulatorySchema, ComplianceReport, DecisionTree, DecisionScore, JointGovernanceDecision, ProvenanceReceipt, JointPerformanceReport, ImprovementPlan | Ecosystem Dashboard, Artifact Browser, Decision Workspace, Joint Decision Room, Execution Console, Governance Panel | MultiPartyDecisionPolicy, regulator consultation guardrail |
