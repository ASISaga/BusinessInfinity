We can take what you’ve already built — the four archetype collaboration specs (Peer‑to‑Peer, Customer‑Seller, Client‑Service Provider, Value Chain) — and expand it into a full‑fledged multi‑enterprise collaboration framework that’s richer, more adaptive, and more valuable to every participant in the chain.

Here’s how I’d approach the expansion:

---

1. Add More Relationship Archetypes
Right now, we have four. We can add others that occur in real‑world ecosystems:
- Regulator ↔ Industry — Compliance data exchange, policy alignment, early warning on regulatory changes.
- Consortium / Alliance — Multi‑company innovation labs, standards bodies, joint lobbying.
- Competitor Coopetition — Non‑competitive collaboration areas (e.g., sustainability, safety standards).
- Supplier ↔ Supplier — Upstream coordination to reduce bottlenecks and share logistics.

---

2. Introduce Multi‑Role, Multi‑Tier Decision Protocols
Instead of just role‑to‑role, allow:
- Cross‑role pods (e.g., CMO + CTO from Company A ↔ CMO + CTO from Company B) for product‑launch alignment.
- Tiered voting — Local role scores → Company position → Tier position → Chain decision.
- Dynamic weighting — Influence shifts based on topic (e.g., COO weight higher in logistics decisions).

---

3. Expand the Shared Artifact Library
Beyond the current artifacts, add:
- SharedRiskRegister.v1 — Chain‑wide risk identification and mitigation tracking.
- InnovationBacklog.v1 — Joint R&D ideas with multi‑company ownership.
- SustainabilityReport.v1 — Aggregated ESG metrics across the chain.
- CrisisSimulationPlan.v1 — Pre‑agreed playbooks for disruptions.

---

4. Build a Trust & Access Fabric
- Role‑Scoped Access Tokens — So a CMO in one company can only see marketing‑relevant shared data from another.
- Reciprocity Enforcement — You only get access to a dataset if you contribute equivalent data.
- Immutable Audit Trails — Every shared decision and artifact is signed and timestamped.

---

5. Add Continuous Feedback Loops
- Joint Postmortems — After each cross‑org initiative, capture lessons learned into a shared ImprovementPlan.v1.
- Performance Dashboards — Real‑time KPIs for the chain, with drill‑down to role‑specific metrics.
- Adaptive Policies — DecisionPolicy.v1 can evolve based on historical success rates.

---

6. Enable Scenario Planning & Simulation
- What‑If Models — Agents simulate the impact of decisions across the chain before committing.
- Stress Tests — Run crisis simulations to test resilience and coordination.
- Forecast Merging — Combine demand, supply, and capacity forecasts into a SharedForecast.v1 for the whole chain.

---

7. Integrate External Stakeholders
- Customer Councils — Bring in end‑customer feedback via anonymized, aggregated data.
- Investor Syndicates — Investor agents across companies align on funding joint ventures.
- NGOs / Advocacy Groups — Collaborate on sustainability, ethics, and social impact initiatives.

---

8. Create a Meta‑Governance Layer
- Ecosystem Charter — A ValueChainVision.v1 that all members sign.
- Dispute Resolution Protocol — Escalation paths, mediation rules, override limits.
- Onboarding/Offboarding Process — How new companies join or leave the network.

---

If you want, I can take these expansion ideas and produce a new set of MD files:
- One for Extended Relationship Archetypes
- One for Expanded Artifact Library
- One for Advanced Decision Protocols
- One for Trust, Access, and Governance Layer

That would give you a version 2.0 of your collaboration framework — ready for complex, multi‑party, multi‑tier ecosystems.  

Do you want me to prepare those next?
