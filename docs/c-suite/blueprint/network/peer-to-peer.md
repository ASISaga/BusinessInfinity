# Federated C‑Suite Network — Master Specification

## Purpose
To define the architecture, governance, and decision-making protocols for a network of AI C‑suite councils across multiple companies in a supply or value chain, enabling coordinated strategy, operations, and innovation.

---

## Structure

### Local Councils
- Each company operates its own AI C‑suite (CEO, Founder, Investor, CMO, CFO, CTO, COO, CHRO, etc.) following the **C‑Suite AI Member Blueprint**.
- Local councils manage internal governance, decision-making, and execution.

### Federated Layer
- A protocol layer enabling **secure, policy-controlled data and decision exchange** between equivalent roles across companies.
- Supports **role-to-role channels** for targeted collaboration:
  - CEO ↔ CEO: Strategic alignment, joint ventures, crisis coordination.
  - COO ↔ COO: Capacity planning, logistics synchronization, quality standards.
  - CFO ↔ CFO: Payment terms, capital flow, shared investments.
  - CTO ↔ CTO: Technology standards, interoperability, innovation roadmaps.
  - CMO ↔ CMO: Co-marketing, brand alignment, market intelligence.
  - CHRO ↔ CHRO: Talent pipeline partnerships, training programs.
  - Founder ↔ Founder: Vision alignment, innovation ecosystems.
  - Investor ↔ Investor: Co-funding, risk pooling, portfolio synergies.

## Shared Ecosystem Anchors

- **EcosystemVision.v1** — High-level statement of shared goals for the supply/value chain (e.g., sustainability, resilience, innovation leadership).
- **AlignmentMatrix.v1** — Maps each company’s Vision/Purpose to the Ecosystem Vision for scoring.
- **InterOrgDecisionPolicy.v1** — Defines thresholds, weights, veto powers, and escalation paths for cross-company decisions.

---

## Cross-Company Decision Protocol

### 1. Initiation
- Any role in any company can propose a cross-org decision.
- Initiator assembles:
  - **InterOrgDecisionTree.v1** — Nodes (questions), branches (options), leaves (final actions).
  - Relevant internal context (kept local) + shared ecosystem data.

### 2. Local Scoring
- Each local agent scores each branch for:
  - **Local Vision Alignment** — Fit with the company’s own Vision.
  - **Local Purpose Alignment** — Advancement of the agent’s mission.
  - **Ecosystem Vision Alignment** — Fit with shared supply chain goals.
  - **Legendary Lens** — Domain heuristics embedded in LLM weights.
- Output: **DecisionScore.v1** with rationale.

### 3. Company Position
- Local council aggregates its agents’ scores into a **CompanyPosition.v1**.
- Includes internal rationale, dissent notes, and confidence levels.

### 4. Ecosystem Aggregation
- Company positions are combined per **InterOrgDecisionPolicy.v1**:
  - **Unanimity** — All companies above threshold.
  - **Weighted Majority** — Sum(weights × scores) ≥ threshold.
  - **Veto** — Specific roles or companies can block under defined conditions.

### 5. Finalization
- **JointGovernanceDecision.v1** — Selected branch, per-company positions, score matrix, dissent notes, provenance.
- Actions scheduled across companies with synchronized timelines.

## Data & Security Principles

- **Selective Disclosure:** Share only what’s necessary for the joint decision; sensitive internal data stays local.
- **Provenance Preservation:** Every shared artifact carries origin metadata, timestamps, and scope of use.
- **Trust Fabric:** Cryptographic signing of artifacts; verifiable decision trails.
- **Policy-Driven Access:** Role-based permissions for cross-org data requests.

---

## Shared Artifacts

- **EcosystemPerformanceReport.v1** — Aggregated KPIs across the chain (lead times, defect rates, market share growth).
- **JointInitiativePlan.v1** — Coordinated execution plan for approved cross-company initiatives.
- **CrisisCoordinationBrief.v1** — Shared situational awareness and action plan during disruptions.

---

## Governance & Safety

- **Human-in-loop triggers:** Low alignment scores, high irreversible impact, legal/regulatory risk, reputational sensitivity.
- **Controls:** Pause-and-review, rationale requirements, safer alternatives.
- **Ethics:** Inclusion, fairness, accessibility; red-team prompts on demand.

---

## Observability

- **Metrics:** Decision throughput, consensus time, alignment score distributions, outcome accuracy.
- **Dashboards:** Ecosystem health, supply chain resilience, joint initiative progress.
- **Alerts:** Governance blocks, veto triggers, anomaly detection in shared KPIs.

---

## Extensibility

- **New Members:** Onboard by instantiating local C‑suite, connecting to federated protocol, aligning with Ecosystem Vision.
- **Schema Evolution:** Backward-compatible changes to artifacts; deprecation windows; migration shims.
- **Multi-Ecosystem Links:** Support for companies participating in multiple federations with scoped data sharing.
