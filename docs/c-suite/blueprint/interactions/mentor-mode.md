# Business Infinity — Mentor Mode Specification

## Purpose
Provide a safe, guided environment for fine‑tuning and testing domain‑specific LLMs, allowing stakeholders to mentor agents, test reasoning, and adjust domain lexicons without impacting live operations.

---

## Objectives
- Allow controlled experimentation with model behaviour.
- Capture human feedback as structured training signals.
- Test model responses against historical and synthetic scenarios.

---

## Key Features
- **Sandboxed Environment:** Isolated from production decision loops.
- **Prompt/Response Testing:** Evaluate outputs against expected reasoning patterns.
- **Domain Lexicon Editor:** Add, remove, or adjust domain‑specific terms and heuristics.
- **Scenario Playback:** Replay past decisions with updated models.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Compare model versions on accuracy, alignment, and confidence.
- **Mentor Feedback Loop:** Store feedback for future fine‑tuning.

---

## UI Modules
- **Mentor Console:** Prompt editor, output viewer, scoring panel.
- **Scenario Library:** Select past or synthetic cases for testing.
- **Lexicon Manager:** Curate domain‑specific vocabulary and rules.
- **Version Tracker:** View and compare model versions.

---

## Interaction Flows
1. **Select Scenario → Test Model:** Choose case → run prompt → review output → score.
2. **Lexicon Update → Retest:** Edit terms → rerun scenario → compare results.
3. **Version Comparison:** Select two model versions → run same scenario → compare metrics.

---

## Governance & Trust Elements
- Clear separation between sandbox and production.
- Version control with rollback capability.
- Audit trail of all mentor interventions.

---

## Observability
- Track number of tests run, feedback items logged, lexicon changes made.
- Monitor model performance trends over time.
