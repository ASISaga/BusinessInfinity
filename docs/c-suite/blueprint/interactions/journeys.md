# Business Infinity — Macro-Level Journeys

## Purpose
To define high-level, end-to-end operational patterns that describe how Business Infinity’s static architecture, dynamic behaviours, and interaction modes work together in major recurring scenarios.

---

## Macro Journey 1 — Event-Driven Governance Cycle

**Trigger:**  
A significant internal, external, or cross‑org event enters the system.

**Flow:**
1. **Event Ingestion (Dynamic Layer):**  
   MCP servers normalise and tag the event (scope, urgency, domain).
2. **Governance Dashboard (IXL):**  
   Role‑specific dashboards surface the alert with relevant KPIs and guardrail status.
3. **Mode Transition:**  
   - If straightforward → decision taken in Dashboard.  
   - If complex → escalate to Boardroom for deliberation.
4. **Boardroom (IXL):**  
   Multi‑agent discussion, artifact linking, live scoring, consensus building.
5. **Governance Decision:**  
   Aggregated into GovernanceDecision.v1 or JointGovernanceDecision.v1.
6. **Execution:**  
   Actions triggered via MCP integrations; provenance recorded.
7. **Outcome Tracking:**  
   PerformanceReport.v1 or JointPerformanceReport.v1 generated.
8. **Learning:**  
   ImprovementPlan.v1 created; model/policy updates scheduled.

**Value:**  
Ensures rapid, transparent, and policy‑compliant response to high‑impact events.

## Macro Journey 2 — Model Improvement Loop

**Trigger:**  
Repeated misalignment or suboptimal reasoning detected in agent outputs.

**Flow:**
1. **Detection:**  
   KPI trends or override frequency in Dashboard indicate an issue.
2. **Mode Transition:**  
   Flagged decisions/scenarios sent to Mentor Mode.
3. **Mentor Mode (IXL):**  
   - Scenario replay and prompt testing.  
   - Lexicon adjustments.  
   - Model version comparison.
4. **Evaluation:**  
   Performance benchmarks confirm improvement.
5. **Governance Review:**  
   Updated model submitted via Dashboard for approval.
6. **Deployment:**  
   New model version replaces old in production.
7. **Monitoring:**  
   Dashboard tracks post‑deployment performance.

**Value:**  
Continuously improves domain‑specific LLM performance without risking live operations.

## Macro Journey 3 — Strategic Collaboration Across the Value Chain

**Trigger:**  
A multi‑company initiative (e.g., joint product launch, shared sustainability goal).

**Flow:**
1. **Initiation:**  
   SharedEvent.v1 created by initiating partner; tagged `value_chain`.
2. **Ecosystem Dashboard:**  
   All relevant partners see the opportunity and related KPIs.
3. **Boardroom (Federated):**  
   Cross‑company C‑suite agents deliberate using relevant archetype (e.g., Customer–Seller, Consortium).
4. **Joint Governance Decision:**  
   Consensus reached per InterOrgDecisionPolicy or MultiPartyDecisionPolicy.
5. **Execution:**  
   Coordinated actions across companies; shared artifacts updated.
6. **Outcome Tracking:**  
   JointPerformanceReport.v1 measures collective results.
7. **Learning:**  
   ImprovementPlan.v1 updates playbooks for future collaborations.

**Value:**  
Aligns multiple organisations on shared goals with transparent decision‑making.

## Macro Journey 4 — Crisis Simulation & Preparedness

**Trigger:**  
Scheduled or ad‑hoc simulation of a high‑impact disruption.

**Flow:**
1. **Simulation Event:**  
   Ecosystem Convener issues SharedEvent.v1 tagged `critical`.
2. **Governance Dashboard:**  
   Alerts all relevant roles; triggers crisis protocols.
3. **Boardroom:**  
   CrisisCoordinationBrief.v1 created; roles and responsibilities assigned.
4. **Decision Loop:**  
   Options scored; contingency plan selected.
5. **Execution:**  
   Simulated actions carried out; provenance recorded.
6. **Outcome Tracking:**  
   JointPerformanceReport.v1 compares simulated vs. target performance.
7. **Learning:**  
   ImprovementPlan.v1 updates real crisis playbook.

**Value:**  
Tests readiness, validates protocols, and strengthens trust in the system.

## Macro Journey 5 — Proactive Strategic Review

**Trigger:**  
Scheduled governance cycle (e.g., quarterly review).

**Flow:**
1. **Preparation:**  
   Dashboard compiles KPIs, DecisionOutcomes, and ImprovementPlans.
2. **Boardroom Session:**  
   C‑suite agents and human stakeholders review strategic alignment and performance.
3. **Mentor Mode (Optional):**  
   Test new strategic scenarios or model behaviours.
4. **Governance Decision:**  
   Update policies, adjust autonomy phases, set new targets.
5. **Execution:**  
   Changes rolled out; provenance recorded.
6. **Monitoring:**  
   Dashboard tracks progress until next cycle.

**Value:**  
Keeps strategy, governance, and AI behaviour aligned with evolving goals.
