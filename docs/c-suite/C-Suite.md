What Is C-Suite?
The term "C-suite" derives from the titles of these senior executives, which tend to start with the letter C, which stands for "chief." Think chief executive officer, chief marketing officer and chief security officer. These C-level executives ensure the different departments of a company work together to achieve its policies and plans.

What Do C-Suite Executives Do?
Each executive is responsible for a particular area within a company's hierarchy. For instance, the chief financial officer prepares budgets and oversees company expenses. The chief data officer manages the company's data strategy and makes data-driven decisions. These senior executives operate one step below the board of directors, although some may also sit on the board.

The number of C-suite executives differs from company to company. Smaller companies and businesses may only have two or three C-suite executives. Midsize companies may have seven or eight, while large companies can have 17 or more. The number of C-level executives depends on the number of areas considered essential to the company's success and how that workload is managed. A company involved in sustainability may need a chief sustainability officer while a startup specializing in cutting-edge products or services may require a chief innovation officer.

Most large companies' C-suite roles don't oversee the organization's day-to-day operations. V-suite executives — like vice presidents — or D-suite executives — such as directors of various departments — fulfill these duties. The employee levels below the C-suite usually depend on each company's corporate structure.

10 Examples of C-Suite Executive Positions
While not every business may have as many as 10 or 12 different members of the C-suite, most companies have some positions in common. These include:

1. Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
The most important member of the C-suite and the top executive within a company. Most other members of the C-suite report to the CEO. They are responsible for hiring the other C-suite executives and usually serve as the face of the company. Notable people who've held this title include Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

The CEO relies on the information provided to him by other members of the C-suite to make crucial decisions. They use this information to create strategies and implement policies that can create a successful business.

When it comes to a CEO's career path, they can come from any background. It's not unusual for a company to hire a CEO who's been successful in a different industry. Usually, the CEO reports only to the board of directors of which they are a member. In some companies, the CEO is also referred to as the company president.

2. Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
Responsible for the company's financial portfolio, budget and investment strategy, the CFO is the top position in a company, usually obtained by someone with a background in accounting or financial analysis. CFOs require a global outlook and work with the CEO to develop new business opportunities. When they find them, they analyze their potential financial risks and benefits.

The CFO is sometimes known as the chief financial and operating officer (CFOO), especially in a small business where titles can often be grouped. The CFO usually sits on the board of directors. Their job is also to ensure that the company has a positive cash flow and spends its capital appropriately, always aiming to stay within budget.

3. Chief Operating Officer (COO)
A chief operating officer typically oversees the company's day-to-day operations and is second in command to the CEO. They're sometimes known as the executive vice president of operations. Tasks include business administration, staffing, recruitment and strategy. If a company doesn't have a chief human resources officer, the COO can assume these human resource functions, which often happens in smaller organizations.

The COO usually sits on the board of directors with the CEO and the CFO.

4. Chief Information Officer (CIO)
Some of the skills necessary for a CIO position include programming, mapping, coding and project management. They can apply the skills in various areas, including finance, risk management and business strategy. They also manage research and development, and ensure that any new technologies adopted by the company align with its goals and strategy.

The CIO is not necessarily the same as the chief technology officer but can serve that purpose in smaller businesses.

5. Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
The CIO and the CTO positions were previously filled by the same person in many businesses. However, as technology has played an increasingly important role in companies' operations, the need to separate the positions has become more urgent. The CTO's responsibilities include overseeing any information system the company uses to run its operations and researching new technologies and how they might benefit the company. They help keep the company competitive and up-to-date with what's happening in technology.

6. Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)
Many CMOs start their careers as sales representatives before becoming sales managers, often advancing to the role of vice president of sales. They may also have started on the marketing side. CMOs develop a deep knowledge of a company's audience and customers.

These days, they must understand how to use social media for marketing their products, building community and heightening brand awareness. They also work on innovation and product development in brick-and-mortar outlets and lead the company's use of marketing strategies around current and new products.

7. Chief Digital Officer (CDO)
A chief digital officer focuses on leading an organization's digital transformation efforts. They develop strategies to use digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and big data analytics to improve business performance and drive innovation. They are responsible for leading organizational change, integrating digital technology across the business and ensuring digital initiatives align with business goals.

The CDO also manages innovation, fostering a culture that encourages new ideas and experimentation with emerging technology. They collaborate closely with other executives, such as the CIO, CTO and CMO to ensure that digital strategies are supported across departments.

8. Chief Experience Officer (CXO)
The chief experience officer is a corporate executive responsible for overseeing the overall user experience (UX) and customer experience (CX) across an organization's products and services. The primary goal of the CXO is to ensure all aspects of interaction between the company and its customers are engaging, efficient and positive, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

The CXO collaborates closely with their C-suite colleagues and other departments, such as marketing, product management and customer service, to create cohesive experience strategies. They play a critical role in bridging the gap between customer expectations and the company's offerings.

9. Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)
The CCO is a senior executive responsible for ensuring the company's employees, business practices and processes comply with both internal policies and external legal and regulatory requirements. This role is critical in maintaining the organization's integrity and reputation by managing risk and ensuring ethical practices across all levels of the company.

In many industries, especially heavily regulated ones like banking, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, the CCO plays a vital role in guiding the company through complex legal environments, ensuring that the company not only avoids penalties and legal action but also upholds its values and ethical standards.

10. Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)
In smaller companies, this position can be fulfilled by the COO. However, larger companies usually employ a CHRO or a Chief People Officer. The CHRO oversees recruitment, onboarding, retention, performance management, training, leadership skills development, succession planning and more.

The CHRO plays a key role in strategic decision-making at the highest levels, working closely with other senior leaders to shape the organization's future. This executive also champions initiatives that promote DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) within the company, enhancing employee satisfaction and retention while driving organizational success.
