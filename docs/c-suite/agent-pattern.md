# 2-C-Suite-Agent-Pattern.md

## Purpose
- **Role:** Define how each C-suite AI (CMO, CFO, CTO, COO, CHRO, etc.) operates as a persistent agent.
- **Goal:** Harmonize autonomous domain decisions through a shared vision while leveraging domain LLMs fine-tuned on legendary knowledge.
- **Scope:** Consistent orchestration pattern; domain-specific LLM weights substitute for stored lexicons.

---

## Composition
- **Agent Identity:** Long-lived persona with policies, access scopes, and audit trail.
- **Domain LLM:** Fine-tuned on domain legends; encodes lexicon and heuristics within weights.
- **Operational Connectors:** MCP servers for channels/systems (e.g., LinkedIn MCP for CMO; Finance/ERP MCP for CFO).
- **Memory Fabric:** Marketing/Finance/HR MCPs providing short-term context and long-term organizational records.
- **Governance Layer:** Enforcement of Vision/Purpose, decision policies, and human-in-loop triggers.

---

## Responsibilities
- **Context Orchestration:**  
  - **Assemble:** Minimal, task-specific context slices from MCP stores and enterprise systems.  
  - **Inject:** Provide on-the-fly bundles to the domain LLM; no internal LLM memory required.
- **Domain Reasoning:**  
  - **Leverage:** Legendary heuristics implicit in LLM weights to score, draft, and critique.  
  - **Align:** Map outputs to Vision/Purpose without external lexicon files.
- **Execution & Monitoring:**  
  - **Act:** Invoke strict MCP tools; respect rate limits and idempotency.  
  - **Observe:** Stream events, collect metrics, and detect anomalies.
- **Memory Stewardship:**  
  - **Short-term:** Maintain operational state; expire or overwrite as needed.  
  - **Long-term:** Persist finalized artifacts, decisions, and learnings.

---

## Human-in-loop and Safety
- **Triggers:** Sensitive topics, low alignment scores, compliance ambiguity, irreversible impact.  
- **Controls:** Pause-and-review, rationale requirements, counter-argument generation by LLM, ethical guardrails.

---

## Interfaces (Agent ↔ Modules)
- **To Memory MCPs:**  
  - **get_context(selectors, horizon)** → task slices  
  - **put_artifact(artifact, horizon)** → ArtifactId
- **To Execution MCPs:**  
  - **execute(intent, payload)** → receipts/events
- **To Domain LLM (dynamic):**  
  - **prompt(task, context, constraints)** → content/score/rationale (shape varies by task)

---

## Evolution
- **LLM Refresh:** Periodic fine-tune or LoRA updates using curated, de-identified outcomes; eval sets track drift.  
- **Red-Teaming:** Adversarial prompts to test domain biases and policy conformance; fixes via fine-tune refresh or prompt strategy.
