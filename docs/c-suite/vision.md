## Purpose
- **Role:** Anchor all C-suite AI decisions in a single, durable company vision and cascading purposes.
- **Goal:** Ensure every action is aligned with the shared vision, and each agent’s domain purpose derived from it.
- **Scope:** Human-crafted statements persisted as artifacts; domain lexicons live inside LLM weights, not as stored objects.

---

## Artifacts
- **Vision.v1:** Company north star, values, non-negotiables, long-horizon goals.
- **Purpose.v1 (per agent):** Cascaded, domain-specific mission owned by each C-suite member (e.g., CMO, CFO, CTO).
- **DecisionPolicy.v1:** Rules for consensus thresholds, veto powers, and escalation paths.
- **AlignmentRubric.v1 (optional):** Lightweight, human-authored guidance that clarifies how to interpret the vision in practice; not a lexicon.

> No DomainLexicon or Legends objects are stored. Domain language and “legendary” heuristics live in each agent’s fine-tuned LLM.

---

## Governance
- **Stewardship:** Executive sponsor maintains Vision.v1; each C-suite agent maintains their Purpose.v1 in lockstep.
- **Versioning:** Content-addressed history with rationale notes for each revision.
- **Traceability:** Every GovernanceDecision links to the Vision/Purpose versions in effect at decision time.

## Interfaces
- **get_vision(version?) → Vision.v1**
- **get_purpose(agent_id, version?) → Purpose.v1**
- **list_policies() → DecisionPolicy.v1[]**
- **active_alignment() → { vision_version, purpose_versions[], policy_version }**
