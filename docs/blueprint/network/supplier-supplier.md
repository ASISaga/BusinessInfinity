# Supplierâ€“supplier collaboration spec

## Purpose
- **Goal:** Coordinate upstream suppliers to reduce bottlenecks, improve quality, and share logistics where non-competitive.
- **Outcome:** Smoother upstream flow, fewer shortages, better quality at lower cost.

## Participants
- **Roles:** COO/CTO of supplier firms; logistics providers; quality leads.

## Typical use cases
- **Capacity pooling:** Shared surge capacity agreements.
- **Logistics sharing:** Consolidated shipments, lane sharing.
- **Quality improvement:** Shared root-cause libraries, process controls.
- **Component standardization:** Interchangeable parts where feasible.

## Shared artifacts
- **PoolingAgreement.v1:** Triggers, compensation, SLAs.
- **SharedLanePlan.v1:** Route, frequency, carriers, cost split.
- **QualityPlaybook.v1:** Defect taxonomy, controls, audits.
- **ComponentSpec.v1:** Tolerances, tests, interchange rules.

## Decision protocol
1. **Initiation:** Supplier proposes pooling/standardization.
2. **Scoring:** Local Vision, Local Purpose, Ecosystem Benefit, Legendary Lens.
3. **Aggregation:** SupplierDecisionPolicy.v1 (veto for IP-sensitive areas).
4. **Finalization:** Signed agreements + ops rollout.

## Governance & trust
- **IP boundaries:** Clear limits; no reverse engineering.
- **Fairness:** Transparent cost allocation and priority rules.
- **Enforcement:** Penalties and exit terms encoded.

## Data sharing & privacy
- **Operational minima:** Share only lanes/volumes necessary.
- **Confidentiality:** NDAs; secure channels with signatures.

## Observability
- **Metrics:** OTIF, load factor, defect ppm, cost per unit-mile.

## Extensibility
- **Tier propagation:** Allow tier-2 suppliers to opt-in with scoped visibility.
