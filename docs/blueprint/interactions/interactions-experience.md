# Business Infinity — Interaction & Experience Layer (IXL) Specification

## Purpose
Define the interaction patterns, user journeys, and experience principles that connect human stakeholders and AI agents to the Business Infinity ecosystem — ensuring clarity, trust, and usability across single-company and federated contexts.

---

## 1. Experience Principles

- **Role‑Centric:** Every interaction is tailored to the stakeholder’s role, responsibilities, and decision scope.
- **Context‑Aware:** UI surfaces the most relevant artifacts, metrics, and actions based on current events and autonomy phase.
- **Transparency‑First:** All AI recommendations and actions are accompanied by rationale, provenance, and alignment scores.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show essential information first; allow deeper exploration on demand.
- **Trust‑Building:** Embed guardrail status, autonomy phase indicators, and override controls visibly in the workflow.
