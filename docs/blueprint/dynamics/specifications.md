# Business Infinity — Dynamics Specification

## Purpose
To define the dynamic behaviours, event flows, and adaptive mechanisms that bring the static Business Infinity architecture to life — enabling continuous sensing, decision-making, execution, and learning in both single-company and federated contexts.

---

## 1. Dynamic Principles

- **Always-On Awareness:** Agents continuously monitor relevant internal, external, and cross-org signals.
- **Event-Driven Response:** State changes are triggered by events, not just scheduled reviews.
- **Progressive Autonomy:** Authority evolves based on performance, trust, and governance rules.
- **Adaptive Coordination:** Influence and decision weights shift based on context.
- **Continuous Learning:** Outcomes feed back into models, policies, and artifacts.

---

## 2. Event Types

### Internal Events
- New sales data, budget variance, production milestone, HR attrition spike.

### External Events
- Market news, competitor launch, regulatory update, supply disruption.

### Cross-Org Events
- Partner forecast change, joint initiative milestone, shared KPI breach.

---

## 3. Event Flow

1. **Emit:** MCP servers publish events to subscribed agents.
2. **Filter:** Agents evaluate relevance based on role, scope, and governance policy.
3. **Assemble Context:** Pull fresh slices from Organizational Data MCP and shared artifacts.
4. **Trigger Decision Loop:** Update or create DecisionTree.v1 as needed.

---

## 4. Decision Loops

### Loop Cycle
1. **Sense:** Gather context from MCPs, artifacts, and event streams.
2. **Think:** Re-evaluate active DecisionTrees with updated data.
3. **Act:** Execute low-risk actions autonomously; escalate others.
4. **Learn:** Update ImprovementPlans and AlignmentMatrix from outcomes.

### Loop Cadence
- **Real-Time:** Anomaly detection, crisis response.
- **Periodic:** Weekly operational reviews, quarterly strategy refresh.

---

## 5. Autonomy Phase Transitions

- **Phase Evaluation:** At each review cycle, agents’ KPIs, override frequency, and stakeholder feedback are assessed.
- **Promotion/Demotion:** Phase changes logged to GovernanceDecision.v1 with rationale.
- **Dynamic Guardrails:** Risk thresholds adjust automatically in response to volatility or confidence levels.

---

## 6. Cross-Agent Orchestration

### Intra-Company
- CEO agent triggers “strategy refresh” → CFO, COO, CMO agents run domain analyses → Merge into GovernanceDecision.v1.

### Inter-Company
- Supplier COO updates SharedForecast.v1 → Manufacturer COO adjusts production → Retailer CMO shifts campaign timing.

### Multi-Tier
- CrisisCoordinationBrief.v1 triggers simultaneous decision loops across all tiers.

---

## 7. Adaptive Weighting

- **Context-Sensitive:** Influence shifts based on decision type (e.g., COO weight ↑ in logistics crisis).
- **Reputation-Based:** Historical accuracy and delivery improve an agent’s influence score.

---

## 8. Simulation & Scenario Testing

- **Pre-Execution:** Run “what-if” simulations using current DecisionTrees and SharedForecasts.
- **Post-Execution:** Compare simulated vs actual outcomes → feed into ImprovementPlans.

---

## 9. Learning Cycles

- **Artifact Evolution:** DecisionTrees, AlignmentMatrix, and PartnershipAgreements updated as the ecosystem changes.
- **Model Refresh:** Domain LLMs periodically fine-tuned with anonymised, high-value learnings from outcomes.
- **Policy Tuning:** DecisionPolicy.v1 parameters adjusted based on historical success rates.

---

## 10. Human–AI Interaction Dynamics

- **Push Alerts:** Agents proactively notify humans of risks, opportunities, and anomalies.
- **Pull Analysis:** Humans can request deep dives or trigger re-evaluation at any time.
- **Negotiation Mode:** MCP-UI supports back-and-forth between humans and agents before finalising a decision.

---

## 11. Governance Integration

- **Guardrail Enforcement:** All autonomous actions checked against active policies.
- **Override Logging:** Human vetoes recorded with rationale.
- **Transparency:** MCP-UI displays decision trails, phase status, and guardrail activity in real time.

---

## 12. Observability

- **Metrics:** Decision throughput, consensus time, alignment score trends, override frequency.
- **Dashboards:** Autonomy phase distribution, promotion readiness, guardrail breach history.
- **Alerts:** Governance breaches, KPI drops, anomaly detection.
