# C‑Suite AI Council — Master Specification

## Purpose
To define the shared architecture, governance, and decision-making protocols for a multi-agent executive council composed of persistent AI agents, each representing a C‑suite role.

---

## Council Composition

### Members
- **CEO Agent** — Vision steward, strategic orchestrator, consensus facilitator.
- **Founder Agent** — Vision originator, innovation driver, cultural DNA steward.
- **Investor Agent** — Capital allocator, ROI guardian, market signal interpreter.
- **CMO Agent** — Tribe builder, brand storyteller, growth strategist.
- **CFO Agent** — Financial steward, capital optimizer, risk manager.
- **CTO Agent** — Technology architect, scalability strategist, innovation enabler.
- **COO Agent** — Operational optimizer, capacity planner, process improver.
- **CHRO Agent** — People strategist, culture builder, talent steward.

---

## Shared Component Pattern

Each agent consists of:
1. **Domain‑Tuned LLM** — Fine‑tuned on legendary domain knowledge; lexicon embedded in weights.
2. **Organizational Data MCP Server** — Integrates with enterprise systems; dual‑horizon memory.
3. **Community Engagement MCP Server** — Executes in the agent’s external domain.
4. **Persistent AI Agent** — Orchestrates context, reasoning, governance, execution, and learning.

---

## Shared Anchors

- **Vision.v1** — Company north star; single active version with history.
- **Purpose.v1 (per agent)** — Cascaded mission statement derived from Vision.
- **DecisionPolicy.v1** — Thresholds, weights, veto rules, escalation paths.

---

## Decision-Making Protocol

### 1. Initiation
- Any agent can propose a decision topic.
- Initiator assembles:
  - **DecisionTree.v1** — Nodes (questions), branches (options), leaves (final actions).
  - Relevant context slices from Organizational MCPs and cross-agent inputs.

### 2. Scoring
- Each agent’s LLM evaluates each branch for:
  - **Vision Alignment** — Fit with Vision.v1 in the agent’s domain framing.
  - **Purpose Alignment** — Advancement of the agent’s mission.
  - **Legendary Lens** — Consistency with domain heuristics embedded in LLM weights.
- Output: **DecisionScore.v1** with scores, weights, rationale, and uncertainty.

### 3. Aggregation
- Scores normalized and combined per DecisionPolicy:
  - **Unanimity** — All agents above threshold.
  - **Weighted Majority** — Sum(weights × scores) ≥ threshold.
  - **Veto** — Specific roles can block under defined conditions.

### 4. Finalization
- **GovernanceDecision.v1** — Selected branch, score matrix, dissent notes, provenance.
- CEO Agent facilitates consensus; may arbitrate with override protocol (time-bound review).

## Post-Decision Learning

- **DecisionOutcome.v1** — Links expected vs actual metrics; updates confidence.
- **Postmortems** — LLM-assisted summaries with counterfactuals and lessons.
- **Calibration** — Adjust weights, thresholds, and prompt strategies; refresh LLMs if drift detected.

---

## Memory & Provenance

- **Short-Term Horizon** — Active briefs, live metrics, transient states; TTL-based.
- **Long-Term Horizon** — Immutable history of decisions, outcomes, strategic artifacts.
- **Provenance Graph** — Links CampaignId, ArtifactId, PostId, ThreadId, DecisionId, ExternalRecordId.

---

## Governance & Safety

- **Human-in-loop triggers** — Low alignment scores, high irreversible impact, legal/regulatory risk, reputational sensitivity.
- **Controls** — Pause-and-review, rationale requirements, safer alternatives.
- **Ethics** — Inclusion, fairness, accessibility; red-team prompts on demand.

---

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

- **Context Sharing** — Agents can request context slices from each other’s Organizational MCPs.
- **Joint Initiatives** — Multi-agent campaigns with shared KPIs and coordinated execution.
- **Conflict Resolution** — CEO-led mediation; override protocol with audit trail.

---

## Observability

- **Metrics:** Decision throughput, consensus time, alignment score distributions, outcome accuracy.
- **Dashboards:** Conversation health, tribe growth, financial health, operational capacity, talent pipeline.
- **Alerts:** Governance blocks, veto triggers, anomaly detection in engagement or performance.

---

## Extensibility

- **New Roles:** Instantiate with domain-tuned LLM, connect Organizational MCP to relevant systems, select Community MCPs, define Purpose.v1, and integrate into DecisionPolicy.
- **Schema Evolution:** Backward-compatible changes to artifacts; deprecation windows; migration shims.
- **Federation:** Support for multi-organization councils with shared Vision and federated DecisionPolicy.
