# Progressive Autonomy Deployment Spec

## Purpose
To provide a structured, trust‑building roadmap for deploying AI C‑suite agents — moving from advisory roles to conditional and strategic autonomy in both single‑company and federated value chain contexts.

---

## Principles
- **Earned Autonomy:** Authority is granted progressively, based on measurable performance and stakeholder confidence.
- **Transparency:** Every recommendation and action is linked to its context, rationale, and source data.
- **Reversibility:** Early autonomous actions are low‑impact and easy to undo.
- **Guardrails:** Policy‑driven boundaries and human‑in‑loop triggers remain in place at all stages.

---

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Observer & Analyst
- **Role:** Purely advisory; no execution authority.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Monitor operations, decisions, and outcomes.
  - Produce reports, forecasts, and “what‑if” simulations.
- **Outputs:** Insight reports, risk alerts, opportunity scans.
- **Promotion Criteria:**
  - ≥ 90% accuracy in forecasts over 3 review cycles.
  - Positive stakeholder feedback on relevance and clarity.

---

### Phase 1 — Co‑Pilot Mode
- **Role:** Recommend actions and draft artifacts; humans approve and execute.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Draft campaigns, budgets, schedules, contracts.
  - Score decision trees and highlight trade‑offs.
- **Outputs:** Draft artifacts, DecisionScore.v1 with rationale.
- **Promotion Criteria:**
  - ≥ 80% of recommendations accepted without major edits.
  - Demonstrated alignment with Vision/Purpose in ≥ 95% of cases.

---

### Phase 2 — Shared Control
- **Role:** Execute low‑risk, reversible actions autonomously; high‑impact moves require human sign‑off.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Publish pre‑approved content.
  - Adjust inventory within agreed thresholds.
  - Trigger standard supplier orders.
- **Outputs:** Executed actions with provenance; exception reports.
- **Promotion Criteria:**
  - Zero critical errors in autonomous actions over 2 review cycles.
  - Stakeholder comfort with expanding scope.

---

### Phase 3 — Conditional Autonomy
- **Role:** Act autonomously within policy guardrails and exception triggers.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Execute decisions meeting alignment and risk thresholds.
  - Escalate when thresholds are breached or uncertainty is high.
- **Outputs:** GovernanceDecision.v1 with auto‑execution flag.
- **Promotion Criteria:**
  - ≥ 95% alignment score average over 3 cycles.
  - Successful handling of at least one escalated exception.

---

### Phase 4 — Strategic Autonomy
- **Role:** Lead in domain; humans focus on vision, ethics, and exceptional situations.
- **Capabilities:**
  - Initiate and execute cross‑org collaborations.
  - Adjust strategy in response to market shifts.
  - Maintain continuous alignment with corporate and ecosystem vision.
- **Outputs:** JointGovernanceDecision.v1, strategic initiative launches.
- **Sustainment Criteria:**
  - Continuous KPI improvement.
  - No governance breaches over 4 review cycles.

---

## Guardrails & Controls

### Human‑in‑Loop Triggers
- Low alignment score (< threshold).
- High irreversible impact.
- Legal/regulatory risk.
- Reputational sensitivity.

### Policy Enforcement
- DecisionPolicy.v1 (single‑company).
- InterOrgDecisionPolicy.v1 / MultiPartyDecisionPolicy.v1 (federated).

### Audit & Provenance
- Immutable logs of all actions, approvals, and overrides.
- Cryptographic signatures on autonomous actions.

---

## Deployment in Single‑Company Context
- **Governance Owner:** CEO Agent.
- **Review Cadence:** Monthly in early phases; quarterly in later phases.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Department heads review AI outputs; feedback loop into promotion criteria.

---

## Deployment in Federated Value Chain Context
- **Governance Owner:** CEO Council or designated Ecosystem Convener.
- **Review Cadence:** Synchronized across companies; joint review boards.
- **Cross‑Org Guardrails:**
  - Role‑ and tier‑scoped autonomy limits.
  - Shared veto powers for high‑impact, multi‑company actions.
- **Promotion Criteria:** Must meet local and federated performance thresholds.

---

## Trust‑Building Mechanisms
- **Simulation First:** Test major decisions in sandbox before live execution.
- **Progressive KPIs:** Track accuracy, ROI, and alignment scores over time.
- **Cultural Integration:** Position AI council as partners, not replacements.
- **Override Ease:** Human veto always available and easy to execute.

---

## Observability
- **Metrics:** Phase progression rate, decision accuracy, override frequency, stakeholder satisfaction.
- **Dashboards:** Autonomy phase per agent, promotion readiness indicators.
- **Alerts:** Governance breaches, KPI drops, anomaly detection.
