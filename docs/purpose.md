Purpose Statement  
"To equip every founder and organisation with a perpetual, self‑evolving Boardroom of legendary Agents — seamlessly integrated with their tools and steered by their vision — so they can make the right decisions, at the right time, every time, without being constrained by resources, speed, or scale."

This keeps the why front and centre:  
- Empowerment — giving access to legendary‑level expertise from day one.  
- Alignment — every move is guided by the founder’s or organisation’s vision.  
- Liberation — removing the structural limits that slow growth or innovation.
