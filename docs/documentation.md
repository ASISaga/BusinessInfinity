## Unified Documentation Guidance

All core features (agent orchestration, storage, environment, ML pipeline, MCP, authentication) are now implemented and maintained in the AgentOperatingSystem (AOS). Documentation for these features is maintained in the AOS repository. BusinessInfinity documentation should only cover business-specific logic, UI, and orchestration patterns.

For details on core features, see the documentation in `RealmOfAgents/AgentOperatingSystem` and its `docs/` directory.
