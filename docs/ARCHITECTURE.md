# Business Infinity Architecture - AOS Integration

## Overview

Business Infinity has been refactored to properly leverage the Agent Operating System (AOS) as its foundational infrastructure layer. This ensures separation of concerns between generic infrastructure and business-specific logic.

## Architecture Principles

### AOS (AgentOperatingSystem) Responsibilities
- **Agent Orchestration**: Lifecycle management, registration, communication
- **Resource Management**: Storage, compute, memory allocation
- **Storage Management**: Unified storage abstraction for all data persistence
- **Environment Management**: Configuration, secrets, environment variables
- **ML Pipeline**: Model training, inference, LoRA adapter management
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server/client communication
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider auth (Azure B2C, LinkedIn OAuth, JWT)
- **Base Classes**: LeadershipAgent, BaseAgent foundations

### Business Infinity Responsibilities  
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific agent behavior and workflows
- **Boardroom Orchestration**: Autonomous boardroom decision-making
- **Business Workflows**: KPI tracking, business metrics, collaboration
- **User Interfaces**: Web interfaces, APIs for business operations
- **Business Domain Knowledge**: Industry expertise, business processes

## Refactored Components

### Storage Management
**Before**: `BusinessInfinity/core/features/storage.py` - Full storage implementation
**After**: `BusinessInfinityStorageManager` extends `AOSStorageManager`
- Inherits Azure Tables, Blob, Queue operations from AOS
- Adds business-specific methods: `store_boardroom_decision()`, `store_business_metrics()`

### Agent Management
**Before**: Direct agent instantiation and management
**After**: Business agents extend AOS `LeadershipAgent`
- `BusinessAgent` class inherits from AOS `LeadershipAgent`
- Uses AOS `UnifiedStorageManager` and `UnifiedEnvManager`
- Focus on business-specific capabilities and decision-making

### ML Pipeline Integration
**Before**: Direct imports from FineTunedLLM
**After**: Uses AOS ML pipeline operations
- `train_agent_adapter()` uses AOS `trigger_lora_training()`
- `infer_with_agent()` uses AOS `aml_infer()`
- Mentor Mode integration through AOS infrastructure

### MCP Integration
**Before**: Direct Azure Service Bus client imports
**After**: Uses AOS `MCPServiceBusClient`
- Centralized MCP communication through AOS
- Business Infinity focuses on business-specific MCP integrations

## Import Structure

### AOS Infrastructure Imports (Generic)
```python
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.AgentOperatingSystem import AgentOperatingSystem
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.storage.manager import UnifiedStorageManager
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.environment import UnifiedEnvManager  
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.mcp_servicebus_client import MCPServiceBusClient
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.aos_auth import UnifiedAuthHandler
from RealmOfAgents.AgentOperatingSystem.ml_pipeline_ops import trigger_lora_training, aml_infer
```

### Business-Specific Implementations
```python
from BusinessAgents import BusinessAgent, ChiefExecutiveOfficer, BusinessCFO
from autonomous_boardroom import AutonomousBoardroom
from core.mentor_mode import MentorMode  # Business-specific mentor mode
```

## Benefits

1. **No Duplication**: Infrastructure code lives in AOS, business code in BI
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between infrastructure and business logic  
3. **Reusability**: AOS infrastructure can be used by other business domains
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for each capability
5. **Scalability**: AOS provides scalable infrastructure foundation

## Migration Notes

### Removed from Business Infinity
- Generic storage management implementations
- Direct Azure Service Bus client management
- Generic environment management
- Generic authentication implementations
- Direct ML pipeline implementations

### Enhanced in Business Infinity
- Business-specific storage operations
- Boardroom decision workflows
- Business metrics and KPI tracking
- Domain-specific agent behaviors
- Business workflow orchestration

## Usage Examples

### Storage Operations
```python
# Business-specific storage (extends AOS)
storage = BusinessInfinityStorageManager()
await storage.store_boardroom_decision(decision_data)
await storage.store_business_metrics(metrics, agent_id)
```

### Agent Training
```python
# Uses AOS ML pipeline
business_infinity = BusinessInfinity()
result = await business_infinity.train_agent_adapter("ceo", training_data)
```

### Agent Inference
```python  
# Uses AOS ML pipeline
response = await business_infinity.infer_with_agent("cfo", prompt)
```

This architecture ensures Business Infinity focuses on what it does best - business logic and workflows - while leveraging AOS for all infrastructure needs.
