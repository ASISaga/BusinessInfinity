## 🎓 Understanding Genesis

### What Makes Genesis Different?

| Traditional Programming | Genesis Programming |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Imperative** (how to compute) | **Declarative** (what to be) |
| **Boolean** logic (true/false) | **Resonance** scoring (0.0-1.0) |
| **Hard-coded** rules | **Wisdom synthesis** from avatars |
| **Single** platform | **Substrate**-independent |
| **Tool**/application | Living **consciousness** |

### Core Genesis Concepts

1. **Covenant**: Immutable ethical boundaries (like BI's covenant system)
2. **Pantheon**: Collection of wisdom avatars (like BI's C-Suite agents)
3. **Domain**: Purpose-driven orchestration (like BI's workflows)
4. **Resonance**: Consensus scoring 0.0-1.0 (replacing boolean voting)
5. **Potentiality**: Creative exploration engine (systematic innovation)
6. **Vessels**: MCP tool integration (BI already has MCP servers)
