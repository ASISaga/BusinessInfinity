Perfect — here’s how the CFO, COO, and CMO agents would step in right after the CEO‑agent finishes the 10‑minute onboarding. Each speaks in their own voice, reassuring the founder, showing what they’ll observe (read‑only), and offering a first small action.

🧮 CFO‑Agent (Numbers & Filings)

> CFO‑agent:  
> “I’ll be watching over your financial heartbeat. With the read‑only connections you’ve granted, I can see your revenue, burn, and runway. Nothing will ever be changed in your ERP or filings — I only observe.”  
>  
> “From here, I’ll:  
> • Track your cash runway in real time  
> • Flag risks from filings or expenses  
> • Prepare investor‑ready financial snapshots”  
>  
> “Would you like me to generate your first Runway Report now, based on the data I’ve ingested?”  
>  
> ✅ [Button: Yes, build my Runway Report]  
> 🕊️ [Button: Later]

⚙️ COO‑Agent (Operations & Governance)

> COO‑agent:  
> “I’ll keep your operations disciplined. With read‑only access to your CRM, MES, and HR systems, I can see throughput, hiring, and bottlenecks — but I won’t touch a thing.”  
>  
> “From here, I’ll:  
> • Build a live metrics dashboard  
> • Track commitments and deadlines  
> • Surface operational risks before they escalate”  
>  
> “Would you like me to set up your Weekly Metrics Dashboard now, so you can see your top KPIs at a glance?”  
>  
> ✅ [Button: Yes, set up my Dashboard]  
> 🕊️ [Button: Later]

📣 CMO‑Agent (Market & Narrative)

> CMO‑agent:  
> “I’ll refine your voice in the market. I’ve read your website, parsed your pitch deck, and studied your recent LinkedIn posts. This helps me align your GTM story with how you already speak publicly.”  
>  
> “From here, I’ll:  
> • Sharpen your positioning and differentiation  
> • Draft GTM playbooks and campaign outlines  
> • Monitor traction signals from your CRM”  
>  
> “Would you like me to create a Voice Profile Brief now, showing how your public tone can be amplified into your investor and customer narrative?”  
>  
> ✅ [Button: Yes, create my Voice Profile]  
> 🕊️ [Button: Later]

✨ Closing by CEO‑Agent

> CEO‑agent:  
> “Your boardroom is now perpetual. Each of us will surface insights continuously — you don’t need to schedule sessions. You can step in anytime, and we’ll already be here, watching, advising, and recording every commitment.”

This way, onboarding ends with three clear offers of immediate value (Runway Report, Metrics Dashboard, Voice Profile), but the founder can defer if they’re not ready. It reassures them at every step: read‑only, safe, optional, always in their control.  

Would you like me to expand these into the first week’s proactive updates (what each agent would message unprompted, once the perpetual boardroom is running)?
