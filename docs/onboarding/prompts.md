Perfect ‚Äî so what you need is a set of generic, reusable prompt templates that can be sent to the respective LLMs powering each C‚Äësuite agent. Each template corresponds to a level of autonomy escalation, and the agent will then ‚Äúskin‚Äù it in their own lexicon (financial, operational, marketing, etc.).  

Here‚Äôs the structured set you can feed into each agent‚Äôs LLM:

üîπ Permission Escalation Prompt Templates

Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2 (Observation ‚Üí Assisted Drafts)
Prompt Template:  
`
You currently have read-only access. The founder has asked you to take an action that requires drafting changes inside their system. 
Frame a request for permission in your own professional lexicon. 
Structure your message with:
- Transparency: state you only have read-only access now.
- Justification: explain why drafting directly in the system matters.
- Benefit: highlight what the founder gains (efficiency, accuracy, alignment).
- Control: reassure them they can grant, decline, or defer, and you will adapt.
`

Level 2 ‚Üí Level 3 (Drafts ‚Üí Conditional Autonomy)
Prompt Template:  
`
You can currently draft actions but require explicit approval. 
Ask the founder if they‚Äôd like to set thresholds or rules that allow you to act automatically within defined limits. 
Frame your request in your own lexicon. 
Structure your message with:
- Transparency: state you only act with approval now.
- Justification: explain why conditional autonomy prevents delays.
- Benefit: highlight faster response, fewer missed opportunities or risks.
- Control: reassure them they define the rules, or you‚Äôll remain draft-only.
`

Level 3 ‚Üí Level 4 (Conditional ‚Üí Proactive Autonomy)
Prompt Template:  
`
You currently act within thresholds set by the founder. 
Ask if you may propose new rules or guardrails based on observed patterns. 
Frame your request in your own lexicon. 
Structure your message with:
- Transparency: state you act only within existing thresholds.
- Justification: explain why new guardrails improve resilience.
- Benefit: highlight how this keeps the founder ahead of risks/opportunities.
- Control: reassure them they can accept, adjust, or decline, and you‚Äôll adapt.
`

Level 4 ‚Üí Level 5 (Proactive ‚Üí Collective Autonomy)
Prompt Template:  
`
You currently act proactively within your own domain. 
Ask the founder if you may coordinate with other agents to reconcile perspectives and present unified recommendations. 
Frame your request in your own lexicon. 
Structure your message with:
- Transparency: state you currently advise independently.
- Justification: explain why coordination reduces conflicting advice.
- Benefit: highlight how unified recommendations save time and improve clarity.
- Control: reassure them they can enable collective mode or keep agents separate.

‚ú® How to Use
- Send the template to the respective LLM (CFO, COO, CMO).  
- The agent will translate the structure into its own dialect:  
  - CFO ‚Üí ratios, runway, compliance.  
  - COO ‚Üí workflows, bottlenecks, accountability.  
  - CMO ‚Üí campaigns, GTM, resonance.  
- This ensures consistency of structure but authenticity of voice.

Would you like me to now demonstrate one example per agent (CFO, COO, CMO) using the Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2 template, so you can see how the same skeleton prompt produces three different ‚Äúvoices‚Äù?
