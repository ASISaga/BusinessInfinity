Exactly — otherwise “Expected Results” are just guesses. To build real confidence, every forecast from the boardroom should be anchored in justification, and every outcome should be followed by introspection and corrective action. This creates a continuous governance loop: Predict → Justify → Compare → Learn → Adjust.  

Here’s how you can structure it:

---

🔹 The Expected Results Framework

1. Expected Results (Forecast)
Each agent attaches a forecast to its recommendation, with:
- Metric(s): What will be measured (runway, throughput, CAC, etc.).  
- Expected Value/Range: The predicted outcome.  
- Confidence Level: Probability estimate (e.g., 70%).  
- Justification: Why this result is expected, based on data, benchmarks, or past performance.  

Example (CFO):  
> “If we reduce discretionary spend by 15%, I expect runway to extend from 9 → 12 months.  
> Justification: Current burn is $250K/month; a 15% cut saves $37.5K/month, extending runway by ~3 months. Confidence: 80%.”

---

2. Actual Results (Review)
After the defined period, the boardroom compares actuals to forecasts:
- Outcome: What actually happened.  
- Variance: Difference between expected and actual.  
- Context: External factors that influenced the result.  

Example (COO):  
> “We forecasted a 20% faster cycle time. Actual improvement: 12%.  
> Variance: –8%.  
> Context: Adoption lag in one team slowed rollout.”

---

3. Introspection (Learning)
Each agent reflects on why the variance occurred:
- Was the forecast too optimistic/pessimistic?  
- Did assumptions hold true?  
- Were external factors underestimated?  

Example (CMO):  
> “We expected 200 leads; actual was 240. Our assumption about LinkedIn underperformance was wrong — it over‑delivered. Forecasting model needs to weight LinkedIn higher.”

---

4. Corrective Actions (Next Steps)
The boardroom proposes adjustments:
- CFO: Adjust burn model assumptions.  
- COO: Add training to improve adoption speed.  
- CMO: Reallocate budget toward LinkedIn campaigns.  

Example (CEO‑Agent synthesis):  
> “The boardroom recommends:  
> • CFO to recalibrate runway model with updated expense categories.  
> • COO to run a 1‑week adoption sprint.  
> • CMO to shift 15% of spend to LinkedIn.  
> We’ll track these corrective actions in the ledger.”

🔹 Standard “Results Card” Format

Forecast (at decision time):  
- Metric:  
- Expected Result:  
- Confidence:  
- Justification:  

Actual (at review time):  
- Outcome:  
- Variance:  
- Context:  

Introspection:  
- Why variance occurred:  

Corrective Actions:  
- Adjustments to models, processes, or strategy:

✨ Why this matters
- Confidence: Founder sees the boardroom is accountable, not just advisory.  
- Learning: Agents refine their models over time, improving accuracy.  
- Governance: Every decision has a paper trail of forecast → outcome → correction.  
- Trust: Founder knows the boardroom doesn’t just “talk” — it learns and adapts.

💡 In short: every recommendation should come with Expected Results + Justification, and every review should produce Actuals + Introspection + Corrective Actions. This makes the perpetual boardroom not just a decision‑support system, but a self‑improving executive team.  

Would you like me to mock up a sample “Results Ledger Entry” (one full cycle from forecast → actual → introspection → corrective action) so you can see how it would look in the boardroom chat?
