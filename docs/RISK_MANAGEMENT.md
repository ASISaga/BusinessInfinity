# Risk Management System

## Overview

The Risk Management System provides comprehensive risk tracking, assessment, and mitigation capabilities for Business Infinity. It enables proactive risk identification, systematic assessment, and structured mitigation planning with clear ownership and accountability.

## Key Features

### Risk Registration
- Register and track business risks across all categories
- Assign clear ownership and accountability
- Categorize risks by type (Financial, Operational, Strategic, Compliance, Security, etc.)
- Tag and contextualize risks for easy organization

### Risk Assessment
- Automated severity calculation based on likelihood and impact
- Five-level severity scale (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info)
- Assessment history tracking with timestamps and assessors
- Support for reassessment and severity updates

### Mitigation Planning
- Structured mitigation plan documentation
- Clear mitigation owner assignment
- Deadline tracking with SLA-based defaults
- Progress monitoring and status updates

### SLA Tracking and Escalation
- Automatic SLA assignment based on risk severity
- Overdue risk identification
- Review cadence enforcement
- Escalation workflows for critical risks

### Analytics and Reporting
- Risk summary dashboards
- Filtering by status, severity, category, owner
- Overdue risk reports
- Historical tracking and trend analysis

## Architecture

### Core Classes

#### `Risk`
Represents a business risk with full lifecycle tracking:
```python
@dataclass
class Risk:
    id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    category: RiskCategory
    status: RiskStatus
    owner: str
    identified_date: datetime
    assessment: Optional[RiskAssessment]
    mitigation_plan: Optional[str]
    mitigation_owner: Optional[str]
    mitigation_deadline: Optional[datetime]
    review_cadence_days: int = 30
    last_review_date: Optional[datetime]
    next_review_date: Optional[datetime]
    resolution_date: Optional[datetime]
    tags: Optional[List[str]]
    related_decisions: Optional[List[str]]
    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
```

#### `RiskAssessment`
Captures risk assessment details:
```python
@dataclass
class RiskAssessment:
    likelihood: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    impact: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    severity: RiskSeverity
    assessment_date: datetime
    assessor: str
    notes: Optional[str]
```

#### `RiskRegistry`
Main interface for risk management operations.

### Enumerations

#### `RiskSeverity`
- `CRITICAL`: Immediate action required (SLA: 1 day)
- `HIGH`: Urgent attention needed (SLA: 7 days)
- `MEDIUM`: Important but not urgent (SLA: 30 days)
- `LOW`: Monitor and address when possible (SLA: 90 days)
- `INFO`: Informational, low priority (SLA: 180 days)

#### `RiskStatus`
- `IDENTIFIED`: Risk has been identified
- `ASSESSING`: Risk is being assessed
- `MITIGATING`: Mitigation plan is being executed
- `MONITORING`: Risk is being monitored
- `RESOLVED`: Risk has been resolved
- `ACCEPTED`: Risk has been accepted (no mitigation)

#### `RiskCategory`
- `FINANCIAL`: Financial risks
- `OPERATIONAL`: Operational and process risks
- `STRATEGIC`: Strategic and business model risks
- `COMPLIANCE`: Regulatory and compliance risks
- `SECURITY`: Security and data protection risks
- `REPUTATIONAL`: Brand and reputation risks
- `TECHNICAL`: Technology and infrastructure risks
- `MARKET`: Market and competitive risks

## Usage

### Register a Risk

```python
from risk import RiskRegistry

# Initialize registry
risk_registry = RiskRegistry(storage_manager, config)

# Register a new risk
risk_data = {
    'title': 'Data breach vulnerability in authentication system',
    'description': 'Outdated authentication library with known vulnerabilities',
    'category': 'security',
    'owner': 'ciso@company.com',
    'tags': ['security', 'authentication', 'vulnerability'],
    'context': {
        'affected_systems': ['authentication-service'],
        'discovery_source': 'security-audit'
    }
}

risk = await risk_registry.register_risk(risk_data)
print(f"Risk registered: {risk.id}")
```

### Assess a Risk

```python
# Assess the risk
risk = await risk_registry.assess_risk(
    risk_id=risk.id,
    likelihood=0.8,  # 80% likelihood
    impact=0.9,      # 90% impact if occurs
    assessor='ciso@company.com',
    notes='High likelihood due to public exploit available. High impact due to sensitive data access.'
)

print(f"Risk severity: {risk.assessment.severity.value}")
# Output: Risk severity: critical
```

### Add Mitigation Plan

```python
# Add mitigation plan
risk = await risk_registry.add_mitigation_plan(
    risk_id=risk.id,
    mitigation_plan='Upgrade authentication library to latest version with security patches. Implement additional monitoring.',
    mitigation_owner='cto@company.com',
    deadline_days=1  # Critical risk - 1 day SLA
)

print(f"Mitigation deadline: {risk.mitigation_deadline}")
```

### Track Risk Progress

```python
# Update status as mitigation progresses
risk = await risk_registry.update_risk_status(
    risk_id=risk.id,
    status=RiskStatus.MITIGATING
)

# Review the risk
risk = await risk_registry.review_risk(
    risk_id=risk.id,
    reviewer='ciso@company.com',
    notes='Mitigation plan approved and in progress. Monitoring deployment.'
)

# Mark as resolved
risk = await risk_registry.update_risk_status(
    risk_id=risk.id,
    status=RiskStatus.RESOLVED
)
```

### Query and Reporting

```python
# Get all critical risks
critical_risks = await risk_registry.get_risks_by_severity(RiskSeverity.CRITICAL)

# Get overdue risks
overdue_risks = await risk_registry.get_overdue_risks()

# Get risks by owner
my_risks = await risk_registry.get_risks_by_owner('ciso@company.com')

# Get summary
summary = await risk_registry.get_risks_summary()
print(f"Total risks: {summary['total_risks']}")
print(f"Critical: {summary['by_severity']['critical']}")
print(f"Overdue: {summary['overdue_count']}")
```

## Integration with Decision Workflows

The Risk Registry integrates with Business Infinity's decision workflows to:

1. **Automatic Risk Identification**: Decisions can automatically register associated risks
2. **Risk-Aware Decision Making**: Decision workflows can query relevant risks
3. **Mitigation Tracking**: Link mitigation plans to strategic decisions
4. **Compliance**: Ensure risk assessment is part of governance processes

```python
# Example: Decision workflow with risk identification
async def make_strategic_decision(decision_data):
    # Make decision
    decision = await workflow_engine.execute_decision(decision_data)
    
    # Identify associated risks
    if decision.get('risks'):
        for risk_data in decision['risks']:
            risk_data['related_decisions'] = [decision['id']]
            await risk_registry.register_risk(risk_data)
    
    return decision
```

## SLA Defaults by Severity

| Severity | SLA (Days) | Example Scenarios |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 1 | Security breaches, system outages, critical compliance violations |
| High | 7 | Data quality issues, key customer escalations, audit findings |
| Medium | 30 | Process inefficiencies, minor compliance gaps, technical debt |
| Low | 90 | Long-term strategic concerns, minor operational issues |
| Info | 180 | Informational items, suggestions for improvement |

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Risk Reviews
- Schedule periodic risk reviews based on cadence
- Update assessments as circumstances change
- Archive or resolve stale risks

### 2. Clear Ownership
- Assign specific owners for each risk
- Assign separate mitigation owners when needed
- Ensure accountability through tracking

### 3. Contextual Documentation
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Add relevant tags for categorization
- Link to related decisions and documents
- Include evidence and supporting data

### 4. Proactive Monitoring
- Monitor overdue risks daily
- Escalate critical risks immediately
- Track mitigation progress actively

### 5. Integration with Workflows
- Incorporate risk assessment in decision processes
- Link mitigation plans to strategic initiatives
- Use risk data in governance reporting

## Future Enhancements

- **Risk Scoring Models**: Advanced quantitative risk models
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive risk identification
- **Dashboard UI**: Visual risk heatmaps and trends
- **External Integration**: Import risks from security scanners, audit tools
- **Automated Mitigation**: Trigger automated responses for known risk patterns
- **Risk Simulation**: What-if analysis and scenario planning
