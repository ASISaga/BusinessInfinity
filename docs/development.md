# Business Infinity – Development Objectives

This document outlines the actionable development objectives required to deliver the $50K/year lean startup C‑suite experience.

---

## 1. Core Agent Architecture
- Design and implement **role‑specific agents** (CEO, COO, CFO, CMO) with distinct scopes, vocabularies, and decision frameworks.  
- Build an **orchestration layer** that enables agents to collaborate in “boardroom mode,” debate, and reconcile conflicting recommendations.  
- Ensure **context persistence** so each agent retains awareness of company history, metrics, and prior decisions.  

---

## 2. Persistent Boardroom Environment
- Develop a **boardroom dashboard** that logs all strategic conversations, decisions, and commitments.  
- Implement **24/7 access** with persistent memory of company context.  
- Provide **search and replay functionality** so founders can revisit past boardroom sessions.  

---

## 3. Knowledge Infusion
- Curate and embed **“legendary playbooks”** — distilled insights from proven leaders and timeless strategies.  
- Implement **contextual surfacing** so these insights appear naturally during relevant discussions.  
- Continuously expand the knowledge base with **domain‑specific modules** (e.g., SaaS, fintech, consumer).  

---

## 4. Strategic Depth & Governance
- Create **structured strategy sessions** (monthly/quarterly) where agents generate board‑level reviews on fundraising, GTM, pricing, and hiring.  
- Build a **governance tracker** that records commitments, deadlines, and integrity checks.  
- Add **automated reminders and escalation protocols** for missed commitments.

## 5. CFO Deliverables
- Automate **financial runway reports** with dynamic updates from user inputs.  
- Build a **scenario modeling engine** for hiring, pricing, and fundraising simulations.

---

## 6. CMO Deliverables
- Produce **quarterly GTM playbooks** with positioning, messaging, and campaign outlines.  
- Develop a **narrative framing engine** that adapts the startup’s story for customers, investors, and talent.

## 9. Exclusivity & Premium Layer
- Implement **cohort‑based access controls** to limit the number of $50K customers.
