## Architecture

### Core Components

#### AuditTrailManager
The central audit trail management system that handles:
- Event logging with comprehensive metadata
- Integrity protection and verification
- Query processing and filtering
- Export and reporting functionality

#### AuditEvent Structure
Each audit event contains:
- **Basic Information**: Event ID, timestamp, type, severity
- **Subject Details**: Who performed the action (agent, user, system)
- **Action Information**: What was done and why
- **Context Data**: Detailed contextual information
- **Evidence**: Supporting documentation and references
- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements
- **Compliance Tags**: Regulatory compliance classifications

#### Event Types
- `BOARDROOM_DECISION`: Strategic decisions made by the boardroom
- `AGENT_VOTE`: Individual agent votes on proposals
- `AGENT_PROPOSAL`: Proposals submitted by agents
- `MCP_REQUEST/RESPONSE/ERROR`: MCP server interactions
- `SOCIAL_MEDIA_POST`: Social media actions
- `BUSINESS_TRANSACTION`: Business system actions
- `ACCESS_GRANTED/DENIED`: Access control decisions
- `SYSTEM_STARTUP/SHUTDOWN/ERROR`: System lifecycle events

### Storage Format

Audit events are stored in daily log files using JSONL format:
```
audit_logs/
├── audit_log_2024-01-15.jsonl
├── audit_log_2024-01-16.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each line contains a complete audit event in JSON format with integrity checksums.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Event Logging

```python
from core.audit_trail import get_audit_manager, AuditEventType, AuditSeverity

audit_manager = get_audit_manager()

# Log a basic event
event_id = audit_manager.log_event(
    event_type=AuditEventType.SYSTEM_STARTUP,
    subject_id="system_component",
    subject_type="system",
    action="Component initialized",
    severity=AuditSeverity.MEDIUM,
    context={"version": "1.0.0"}
)
```

### Boardroom Decision Logging

```python
# Log a comprehensive boardroom decision
audit_manager.log_boardroom_decision(
    decision_id="decision_2024_001",
    decision_type="strategic",
    proposed_by="ceo_agent",
    final_decision="Expand into European market",
    rationale="Market analysis shows 40% growth opportunity",
    votes=[
        {"voter_id": "ceo", "vote_value": 0.9, "rationale": "Strong strategic fit"},
        {"voter_id": "cfo", "vote_value": 0.7, "rationale": "Financially viable"}
    ],
    confidence_score=0.85,
    consensus_score=0.80
)
```

### MCP Interaction Logging

```python
# Log MCP server interactions
audit_manager.log_mcp_interaction(
    mcp_server="linkedin",
    operation="create_post",
    subject_id="marketing_agent",
    subject_type="agent",
    success=True,
    request_data={"content": "Company announcement"},
    response_data={"post_id": "12345", "engagement": {"likes": 50}}
)
```

```python
# Log social media actions
audit_manager.log_social_media_action(
    platform="linkedin",
    action_type="post",
    agent_id="marketing_agent",
    content="Exciting news about our AI platform!",
    target_audience="technology_professionals",
    engagement_metrics={"impressions": 1000, "clicks": 50}
)
```

### Business Action Logging

```python
# Log business system actions
audit_manager.log_business_action(
    system="erpnext",
    operation="create_invoice",
    agent_id="finance_agent",
    business_entity="customer_123",
    transaction_data={
        "amount": 5000.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001"
    }
)
```

### Querying Audit Events

```python
from core.audit_trail import AuditQuery
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a query for recent events
query = AuditQuery(
    start_time=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=7),
    event_types=[AuditEventType.BOARDROOM_DECISION],
    subject_types=["agent"],
    limit=100
)

events = audit_manager.query_events(query)
```

### Audit Context Manager

```python
# Use context manager for operation tracking
with audit_manager.audit_context(
    operation="data_processing",
    subject_id="data_processor",
    subject_type="system"
) as context_id:
    # Perform operation
    process_data()
    # Automatic success/failure logging
```

## Command-Line Tools

### Audit Viewer

The audit viewer provides command-line access to audit data:

```bash
# View recent events
python tools/audit_viewer.py recent --hours 24 --limit 50

# View boardroom decisions
python tools/audit_viewer.py decisions --days 7
