# Business Infinity - Consolidated Architecture

## 🔄 **MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED**

This repository has been thoroughly refactored to consolidate all features into a single, coherent architecture. All functionality from multiple directories has been unified into the `core` system while maintaining backward compatibility.

## New Architecture

### Core System (`/core/`)

The new unified system provides all functionality through a single, well-organized module:

```python
# Import everything from the consolidated core system
from core import (
    # Main components
    agent_manager,          # Unified agent management
    mcp_handler,           # Multi-Agent Communication Protocol  
    orchestrator,          # Business process orchestration
    unified_server,        # FastAPI + WebSocket + Static files
    
    # Feature modules
    storage_manager,       # Azure Storage + Tables + Queues + Blob
    ml_manager,           # Azure ML + AML endpoints + Pipelines
    env_manager,          # Environment variables + Configuration
    api_orchestrator      # API coordination + Authentication
)
```

### Consolidated Components

| Component | Previous Location(s) | New Location |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Agent Management** | `/agents/manager.py`, `/azure_functions/server/Operations/` | `core/agents.py` |
| **Server Infrastructure** | `/azure_functions/server/server.py`, `/shared/framework/server/main.py` | `core/server.py` |
| **MCP Communication** | `/shared/framework/mcp/server.py`, `/dashboard/mcp_handlers.py` | `core/mcp.py` |
| **Storage Management** | `/storage/manager.py` | `core/features/storage.py` |
| **ML Pipeline** | `/ml_pipeline/manager.py` | `core/features/ml_pipeline.py` |
| **Environment Config** | `/environment/manager.py`, `/environment/env_manager.py` | `core/features/environment.py` |
| **API Orchestration** | `/api/orchestrator.py` | `core/features/api.py` |

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **All existing imports continue to work:**

```python
# These still work exactly as before
from agents import agent_manager
from storage import storage_manager  
from environment import env_manager
from api.orchestrator import Orchestrator
```

## Key Improvements

### 🎯 **Unified Architecture**
- Single entry point through `core` module
- Consistent API across all components
- Centralized configuration and environment management

### 🔧 **Enhanced Features**
- **Agent System**: Supports Operational, AML, and Semantic agents in one place
- **Server**: Combines FastAPI REST + WebSocket MCP + Static file serving
- **Storage**: Unified Azure Tables + Blob + Queue operations
- **ML Pipeline**: Integrated AML inference + training + pipeline orchestration

### 📈 **Better Scalability**
- Modular feature system in `core/features/`
- Lazy initialization for better performance
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 🧹 **Simplified Dependencies**
- Consolidated `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- No duplicate or conflicting package versions
- Optional imports with graceful fallbacks

## Migration Guide

### For New Code:
```python
# Recommended - use the new core system
from core import agent_manager, storage_manager, orchestrator
```

### For Existing Code:
```python
# No changes needed - backward compatibility maintained
from agents import agent_manager  # Works as before
from storage import storage_manager  # Works as before
```

## Function App Structure

The Azure Functions app structure remains unchanged:

```
function_app.py  # Main entry point
├─ triggers/     # HTTP, Queue, Service Bus triggers  
│  ├─ http_routes.py      # All HTTP endpoints
│  ├─ queue_triggers.py   # Storage queue triggers
│  └─ service_bus_triggers.py  # Service bus triggers
└─ core/         # NEW: Consolidated system
   ├─ agents.py      # Agent management
   ├─ server.py      # Server infrastructure  
   ├─ mcp.py         # Communication protocol
   ├─ orchestrator.py # Business orchestration
   └─ features/      # Feature modules
      ├─ storage.py     # Storage management
      ├─ ml_pipeline.py # ML operations
      ├─ environment.py # Configuration
      └─ api.py         # API orchestration
```

## What Changed

### ✅ Consolidated Features
- **No functionality removed** - everything is preserved
- **No breaking changes** - all APIs maintained
- **Enhanced capabilities** - more features in each component

### 🗂️ File Organization
- Legacy directories maintained for compatibility
- New `core/` system provides unified access
- Triggers updated to use consolidated system

### 📦 Dependencies
- Single comprehensive `requirements.txt`
- All Azure services integrated
- Optional dependencies with fallbacks

---

**Result**: A more maintainable, scalable, and feature-rich system with zero breaking changes.
