All machine learning and large language model (LLM) capabilities are provided by the shared, cross-domain FineTunedLLM module (see RealmOfAgents/FineTunedLLM). BusinessInfinity does not implement its own ML pipeline; instead, it integrates with FineTunedLLM for all domain-specific model training, inference, and LLM-powered features. The AgentOperatingSystem is a reusable, domain-agnostic orchestration and agent management layer, and does not include application-specific storage, environment managers, or ML/LLM logic. This separation of concerns keeps AOS and FineTunedLLM generic and reusable, while BI remains flexible and responsible for its own operational context and leverages shared intelligence.",
