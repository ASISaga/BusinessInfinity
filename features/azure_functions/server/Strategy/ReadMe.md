Three Elements of a company's strategy and operational practices.

### Vision
The vision statement outlines the long-term aspirations of the organization. It describes what the company wants to achieve in the future and serves as a source of inspiration. It's more about the "what" and "where" the company sees itself in the long run.

**Example:** 
*To be the world's most customer-centric company, where customers can find and discover anything they might want to buy online.*

### Mission
The mission statement defines the purpose and primary objectives of the organization. It details what the company does, who it serves, and how it does it. It's more about the "how" and "why" the company exists.

**Example:** 
*To organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful.*

### Values
Core values are the guiding principles that shape the culture and behavior of the organization. They represent what the company stands for and influence decision-making and actions across the organization.

**Example:** 
- Integrity
- Innovation
- Customer Commitment
- Respect for People

These three elements collectively guide a company's strategy and operational practices.
