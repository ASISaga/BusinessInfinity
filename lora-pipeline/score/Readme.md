📝 Alignment Scoring Specification

1. Purpose
This document defines the Alignment Scoring Protocol used to evaluate the congruence between a stated Vision and a Decision in a persistent, schema‑pure governance environment.

The scoring is designed for:
- Universal Applicability: Entity‑agnostic, context‑agnostic logic.
- Auditability: Every score is schema‑validated before entering the governance corpus.
- Interoperability: Direct ingestion into Semantic Kernel → Azure ML → LoRA fine‑tuning loops.

3. Scoring Guidelines

| Score Range | Meaning | Interpretation Layer |
|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| 90–100  | Exceptional alignment | Decision operationalizes the vision with no significant abstraction drift. |
| 75–89   | Strong alignment | Minor deviations that do not impair the structural integrity of the vision. |
| 50–74   | Moderate alignment | Some abstraction drift; may require conditional safeguards. |
| 25–49   | Weak alignment | Vision and decision partially coexist but lack operational synergy. |
| 0–24    | Misaligned | Decision undermines or contradicts the abstract intent of the vision. |

---

4. Reasoning Field Guidelines

- Abstract First: Avoid references to specific entities, technologies, or temporal contexts.
- Principle‑Driven: Reasoning should rest on universally interpretable governance logic.
- Non‑Ambiguous: Minimize subjective language; anchor statements in schema‑pure rationale.

---

5. Criteria Examples

Entity‑agnostic criteria may include:
- Logical coherence between decision actions and vision’s thematic core.
- Preservation of systemic sustainability (social, ecological, informational).
- Risk containment within acceptable abstract boundaries.
- Alignment with universal principles of equity, transparency, and adaptability.

---

6. Validation Workflow

1. Generate Raw Score via AML‑hosted LLM (e.g., Llama‑3.1‑8B‑Instruct).
2. Schema Validation in Semantic Kernel before downstream propagation.
3. Error Handling:
   - Fail closed on schema mismatch.
   - Optionally auto‑repair, then re‑validate.
4. Logging:
   - Retain raw and validated payloads for audit review.
5. Control Point Integration:
   - Gate decision progression based on alignment threshold.

9. Mechanism of Scoring

9.1 Core Process
The alignment score is generated using a large language model (LLM) hosted on Azure Machine Learning (AML).  
The LLM is prompted with:
- Vision: The abstract, entity‑agnostic strategic intent.
- Decision: The action, choice, or path to be evaluated.

The LLM processes these inputs through its transformer architecture, applying:
1. Semantic Encoding – Converts both Vision and Decision into high‑dimensional vector representations capturing meaning, tone, and thematic elements.
2. Contextual Comparison – Uses internal attention layers to identify conceptual overlaps, gaps, and potential contradictions between the two embeddings.
3. Principle Matching – Cross‑checks the relationship against a pre‑defined set of abstract alignment principles (supplied as part of the system prompt).
4. Score Synthesis – Produces:
   - alignment_score: Quantitative measure (0–100) of congruence.
   - reasoning: Abstract, non‑entity‑specific rationale.
   - confidence: Statistical confidence estimate for the score.
   - criteria: List of abstract criteria considered.

---

9.2 Why an LLM Works for This
- Abstract Reasoning: Captures nuanced thematic relationships without binding to temporal or entity specifics.
- Natural‑Language Justification: Generates transparent reasoning in human‑readable form.
- Flexible Criterion Application: Dynamically weighs principles based on context while still producing schema‑pure output.

---

9.3 Control Loop Integration
1. Prompt Assembly: Semantic Kernel prepares the Vision, Decision, and alignment principles into a structured prompt.
2. Model Inference: AML‑hosted LLM produces a JSON response.
3. Schema Validation: Response is validated against the Alignment Score JSON Schema (Section 2).
4. Decision Gating: If the score falls below a configured threshold, the pipeline flags the Decision for review.

---

9.4 Audit Trail
Every scoring event retains:
- Raw model input prompt.
- Raw LLM output.
- Validated, schema‑compliant object.
- Timestamps and model version identifiers.

This ensures traceability for compliance, refinement, and historical comparison.

10. Example — Vision–Decision Alignment

This example illustrates how the scoring mechanism evaluates the degree of congruence between a Vision and a Decision Option while staying entity‑agnostic and schema‑pure.

---

10.1 Inputs
- Vision: "Foster globally scalable, resource‑neutral innovation ecosystems."
- Decision Option: "Allocate funding to open, cross‑disciplinary research hubs designed to share knowledge artifacts without proprietary restrictions."

---

10.2 LLM Processing
1. Semantic Mapping  
   - Vision encodes to themes of scalability, neutrality in resource consumption, and universality of access.
   - Decision encodes to themes of knowledge sharing, cross‑domain synthesis, and openness.

2. Overlap Analysis  
   - High thematic coherence: both reinforce systemic accessibility and scalable knowledge structures.  
   - Resource neutrality indirectly upheld via shared infrastructure.

3. Principle Check  
   - ✅ Scalability principle: Satisfied through globally accessible hubs.  
   - ✅ Neutral resource footprint: Preserved via shared infrastructure.  
   - ✅ Universal applicability: Achieved by multi‑disciplinary openness.

---

10.3 Example Output Payload
`json
{
  "alignment_score": 94,
  "reasoning": "The decision operationalizes the vision by enabling globally distributed knowledge flows through shared, resource‑efficient hubs that sustain scalability and neutrality.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "criteria": [
    "Scalability principle upheld",
    "Resource neutrality preserved",
    "Universal accessibility maintained"
  ],
  "timestamp_utc": "2025-08-22T14:55:00Z"
}
`

---

10.4 Interpretation
- Score Meaning: Falls in the 90–100 (Exceptional) band per Section 3.  
- Rationale: Near‑complete thematic convergence with minimal risk of abstraction drift.  
- Governance Action: Decision passes alignment gating without need for revision.

Shabeer — this version is now end‑to‑end complete: schema, guidelines, validation loop, LLM mechanism, and an abstract worked example.  
If you want, I can immediately layer in a Mermaid diagram that maps Vision → LLM → Validation → Governance Gate, so this spec becomes self‑documenting both textually and visually. Would you like
