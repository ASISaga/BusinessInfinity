# Introduction

This specification describes the BusinessInfinity application — an enterprise boardroom of AI agents built on the Agent Operating System (AOS). It is intended to be the authoritative, machine-consumable specification for implementing, testing, and integrating BusinessInfinity with the broader ASISaga ecosystem (AOS, MCP servers, FineTunedLLM and website modules).

This document was synthesized from the project's documentation and manifest. It is suitable for automated processing by spec-driven tools and MCP agents.
