- **Workflow Orchestration**: Step-by-step process execution
- **Storage Management**: Persistent data and state management
- **System Monitoring**: Performance metrics and health tracking

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
python validate_system.py
```

### Adding New Agents
1. Create agent class inheriting from `BusinessAgent`
2. Implement domain-specific analysis methods
3. Define expertise areas and decision frameworks
4. Register agent in `business_infinity.py`

### Adding New Workflows
1. Define workflow steps in `_get_business_workflow_definition`
2. Map steps to appropriate agents
3. Test workflow execution via API

## Deployment

### Azure Functions Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy
func azure functionapp publish your-function-app-name
```

### Configuration
- Set environment variables in Azure Functions configuration
- Configure Service Bus connections
- Set up monitoring and logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AOS Not Available**: System falls back to MVP agents
2. **Agent Initialization Failed**: Check configuration and dependencies
3. **Decision Timeout**: Verify agent responsiveness and reduce complexity
4. **Workflow Stuck**: Check individual step execution and agent status

### Logging
- Enable DEBUG logging for detailed execution traces
- Check Azure Functions logs for runtime issues
- Monitor Service Bus for message processing status

## Contributing

1. Follow the established architecture patterns
2. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. Add comprehensive tests for new features
4. Update documentation for API changes
