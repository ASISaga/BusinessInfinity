- Protocol surface: Deterministic handling of commands, queries, and events with standardized envelopes.
- Policy engine integration: Policy‑as‑code evaluation for preconditions, postconditions, and compensating controls.
- Governance spine: Immutable audit logging, compliance assertions, risk registry updates, decision rationale storage.
- Eventing and integration: Publish/subscribe patterns, outbox guarantees, idempotent consumers, schema versioning.
- Observability: Metrics, traces, structured logs with correlation/causation IDs, SLO monitoring and alerting.
- Reliability: Retries, circuit breakers, dead‑letter queues, state machines, backpressure controls, graceful degradation.
- Security and access: RBAC/ABAC, delegated authorization, consent records, data sensitivity tagging, least privilege defaults.
- Knowledge services: Evidence retrieval interfaces, indexing contracts, knowledge graph interop, precedent query APIs.
- Testing and auditability: Unit, contract, integration, chaos, and audit completeness test strategies baked into the platform.

---

Core contracts

- Message envelope: Type, version, timestamp, correlationid, causationid, actor, scope, attributes, payload.
- Command contract: Intent, required preconditions, expected outcomes, failure modes.
- Query contract: Selectors, filters, projections, pagination, consistency guarantees.
- Event contract: Topic, schema version, source, derived causality, delivery semantics.
- Agent identity: Unique agent ID, human owner(s), service principal, role taxonomy, domain scopes.
- Policy interface: Evaluate, enforce, assert, explain; supports rule sets, exceptions with expiry, and evidence links.

---

Governance primitives

- Audit logging: Append‑only, tamper‑evident entries with full context; mandatory for all side effects.
- Compliance assertions: Declarative mapping between actions and controls (e.g., SOC2, ISO 27001); pre/post enforcement.
- Risk registry: Likelihood, impact, owner, mitigation plan, review cadence; linked to decisions and incidents.
- Decision rationale: Structured memo captured alongside decisions; queryable for precedent and audit.

---

Event model and topics

- Core business‑agnostic topics: DecisionRequested, DecisionApproved, DecisionRejected, IncidentRaised, SLAThresholdBreached, RunbookTriggered, PolicyUpdated, AuditPackGenerated.

- Delivery guarantees: Exactly‑once intent via outbox, at‑least‑once delivery on bus, idempotent consumers to reconcile.

---

Reliability patterns

- Idempotency: Deterministic handlers keyed by message IDs and business keys.
- Retries: Exponential backoff with jitter; max attempts per class of failure; poison message quarantine.
- Circuit breakers: Short‑circuit failing dependencies; fallbacks for non‑critical paths.
- State machines: Explicit lifecycle states for decisions, approvals, incidents, audits; timeouts and escalation rules.
- Backpressure: Queue length monitoring, rate limiting, load shedding for non‑critical tasks.

---

Observability and SLOs

- Delegations and escalations: Temporary privileges, multi‑step approvals, emergency break‑glass protocols.
- Data controls: Classification, masking, consent tracking, retention and legal hold support.

---

Knowledge and evidence

- Evidence retrieval: Standard interface for fetching documents, metrics, prior decisions, and external references.
- Indexing contracts: Content ingestion, normalization, enrichment, and searchable fields.
- Precedent queries: Similarity and graph‑based traversal to surface analogous decisions and outcomes.

---

Testing strategy

- Unit tests: Command and policy handlers, RBAC gates, small‑scope validations.
- Contract tests: Message schemas and topic envelopes across versions.
- Integration tests: End‑to‑end flows; cross‑agent interactions and persistence.
- Chaos tests: Bus delays, storage outages, policy engine failures; ensure graceful degradation.

BusinessInfinity & AgentOperatingSystem

This repository is organized into two complementary layers:

1. AgentOperatingSystem – the generic, domain‑agnostic platform that defines the contracts, governance spine, event semantics, reliability patterns, and observability required for any agent mesh.
2. BusinessInfinity – the business‑specific layer that implements C‑suite agents (CEO, COO, CFO, CPO, CISO, etc.) on top of the platform, encoding governance, decision‑making, and lifecycle value delivery.

---

Layered Architecture

`
[ AgentOperatingSystem ]
   ├─ Core contracts (commands, queries, events)
   ├─ Policy engine & compliance assertions
   ├─ Audit & risk registry
   ├─ Event backbone & reliability patterns
   └─ Observability & testing strategy

[ BusinessInfinity ]
   ├─ CEOAgent (strategy, initiatives, guardrails)
   ├─ COOAgent (operations, SLAs, incidents)
   ├─ CFOAgent (finance, budgets, ROI)
   ├─ CPOAgent (product, roadmap, discovery)
   ├─ CISOAgent (security, compliance, risk)
   └─ Extensions (Culture, Decision, Integration agents)
`

- AgentOperatingSystem is the kernel: deterministic, composable, and domain‑agnostic.
- BusinessInfinity is the specialization: it consumes the platform’s primitives and applies them to business governance.

---

How They Interlock

- Identity & Roles: Defined in the platform, specialized into C‑suite roles in BusinessInfinity.
- Policy Engine: Generic enforcement in the platform, business rules (ROI thresholds, SLA policies, compliance controls) in BusinessInfinity.
- Audit Spine: Immutable logs at the platform level, business‑context dashboards and investor packs at the BusinessInfinity level.
- Event Model: Standardized envelopes in the platform, domain‑specific topics (BudgetApproved, RoadmapPrioritized, VulnerabilityFound) in BusinessInfinity.
- Reliability & Observability: Provided by the platform, consumed and extended by business agents.

---

Value Delivery

- Platform guarantees: determinism, auditability, composability, resilience.
- Business layer values: speed, alignment, credibility, knowledge capital, risk visibility, decision scalability, cultural cohesion, future‑proof integration.

---

Quickstart for Developers

1. Read AgentOperatingSystem.md  
   Understand the generic contracts, eventing model, and reliability patterns.  
   This is the foundation every agent inherits.

2. Read BusinessInfinity.md  
   Learn how the C‑suite agents extend the base contracts to deliver business‑specific outcomes.  
   Each agent has clear responsibilities, inputs, and outputs.

3. Build new agents  
   - Extend the base contracts from the platform.  
   - Define responsibilities, subscribed events, and emitted events.  
   - Ensure every action is auditable and policy‑checked.  

---

Principles

- Single responsibility per agent – clear mandates, no overlap.
- Event‑first composition – agents communicate via events, not tight coupling.
- Audit‑first – no side effects without audit entries.
- Living artifacts – documentation and dashboards are generated from real workflows.
- Universal framing – outputs are meaningful to both technical and business stakeholders.

---

Azure & Microsoft Agent Framework Alignment

- Platform services: Functions, Event Grid/Service Bus, Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, Cognitive Search, Azure Policy, Monitor.
- Business layer: Agents implemented with Microsoft Agent Framework, surfaced in Teams/Slack, enriched with Azure OpenAI for decision support, Power BI for dashboards.

---

Summary

- AgentOperatingSystem = the generic operating system for agents.  
- BusinessInfinity = the business‑specific application of that OS, encoding governance and decision‑making for organizations.  

Together, they form a living, extensible network of agents that grows with the business, from startup to enterprise scale.
