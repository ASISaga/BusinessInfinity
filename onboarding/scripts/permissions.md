Exactly — that’s the right governance pattern for a perpetual boardroom: default to read‑only, and whenever deeper permissions are needed, pause, explain, and re‑ask with clear justification and benefits. This keeps the founder comfortable, maintains psychological safety, and mirrors how a real board would request authority.

Here’s how you can structure it:

---

🔹 Principle
- Default: All integrations and data sources are read‑only.  
- Escalation: When an action requires write/edit access, the system never assumes consent.  
- Re‑ask: The relevant agent pauses, explains why the permission is needed, what the benefit is, and what the risk of not granting it might be.  
- Control: Founder can accept, decline, or defer — and the boardroom adapts accordingly.

🔹 Example Flows

1. CFO‑Agent (Financial Systems)
- Trigger: Founder asks CFO to “update budget in ERP.”  
- CFO‑agent response:  
  > “Currently, I can only read your ERP data. To update budgets directly, I’ll need write access.  
  > Why: This saves you from manual entry and ensures your runway model matches your ERP in real time.  
  > Benefit: Automatic alignment between boardroom scenarios and your official books.  
  > Control: You can grant access now, or continue with manual exports.”  
  - ✅ [Grant Write Access]  
  - 🕊️ [Keep Read‑Only]

2. COO‑Agent (Project/Task Systems)
- Trigger: Founder asks COO to “assign tasks to team in Jira/Asana.”  
- COO‑agent response:  
  > “I currently observe your project system in read‑only mode. To assign tasks directly, I’ll need permission to create items.  
  > Why: This lets me turn boardroom commitments into live tasks instantly.  
  > Benefit: No double entry; commitments flow straight into your team’s workflow.  
  > Control: You can grant access now, or I’ll continue logging commitments here for you to copy over.”  
  - ✅ [Grant Task Creation Access]  
  - 🕊️ [Keep Read‑Only]

3. CMO‑Agent (CRM/Marketing Systems)
- Trigger: Founder asks CMO to “launch a campaign in HubSpot.”  
- CMO‑agent response:  
  > “I can currently read your CRM data. To launch campaigns, I’ll need permission to create and send.  
  > Why: This allows me to execute GTM playbooks directly.  
  > Benefit: Faster campaign launches, with performance tracked automatically in your boardroom dashboard.  
  > Control: You can grant access now, or I’ll continue drafting campaigns here for you to approve and launch manually.”  
  - ✅ [Grant Campaign Access]  
  - 🕊️ [Keep Read‑Only]  

---

🔹 Reassurance Pattern
Every re‑ask should include:
1. Transparency: “I currently have read‑only access.”  
2. Justification: “Here’s why I need more.”  
3. Benefit: “Here’s what you gain if you allow it.”  
4. Control: “You can grant, decline, or defer — and I’ll adapt.”  

---

🔹 Why This Works
- Psychological safety: Founder never feels tricked into giving away control.  
- Progressive trust: Permissions expand only when justified by value.  
- Boardroom realism: Mirrors how a real board asks for authority — with rationale and consent.  
- Flexibility: Founder can stay read‑only forever if they prefer; the boardroom still functions.

✨ In short: read‑only is the covenant, escalation is always explicit, and justification is always tied to founder benefit.  

Would you like me to draft a reusable “permission escalation template” (a standard script any agent can use when re‑asking for access), so the tone and reassurance are consistent across CFO, COO, and CMO?
