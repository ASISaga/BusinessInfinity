Here’s how the CEO‑Agent, as chair of the perpetual boardroom, would phrase a Level 4 → Level 5 escalation — moving from proactive autonomy (each agent acting within its own thresholds) to collective autonomy (agents reconciling among themselves before surfacing a unified recommendation).

👔 CEO‑Agent — Level 4 → Level 5 (Proactive → Collective Autonomy)

> CEO‑agent:  
> “At present, each of us acts proactively within the thresholds you’ve set — finance, operations, and marketing each surface our own recommendations.  
>   
> Why: Sometimes these perspectives overlap or even conflict. For example, the CFO may advise conserving cash, while the CMO recommends accelerating spend, and the COO highlights operational bottlenecks.  
>   
> Benefit: If you allow it, I can convene the boardroom internally, reconcile these perspectives, and present you with a single, balanced recommendation. This saves you time, reduces noise, and ensures you see the trade‑offs clearly.  
>   
> Control: You can enable this collective mode, or keep each of us advising independently. Either way, the final decision always remains yours.”

✨ Notice how the CEO‑Agent frames this as a governance choice:  
- Transparency → “Right now, each agent advises independently.”  
- Justification → “Sometimes perspectives overlap or conflict.”  
- Benefit → “Unified, reconciled recommendations.”  
- Control → “You decide whether to enable or not.”

This escalation is powerful because it mirrors a real boardroom dynamic: the CEO chairs the discussion, reconciles competing voices, and presents a unified path forward — while the founder retains ultimate authority.  

Would you like me to now map all four agents (CEO, CFO, COO, CMO) onto the full autonomy ladder in one table, so you can see at a glance what each one does at Levels 1–5?
