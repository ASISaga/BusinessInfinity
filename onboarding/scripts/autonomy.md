Great question — because what you’ve already designed (read‑only integrations, contextual parsing, perpetual boardroom presence) is Level 1 autonomy: observing, advising, and surfacing insights without ever touching the founder’s systems.  

The next step in autonomy is about carefully expanding from observation → recommendation → execution, but always under covenantal governance. Here’s how the progression looks:

---

🔹 Levels of Autonomy in the Perpetual Boardroom

Level 1: Observational Autonomy (where you are now)
- Agents have read‑only access.  
- They parse LinkedIn, website, filings, ERP/CRM/MES feeds.  
- They observe, analyze, and advise — but never act.  
- Founder feels safe: nothing can break.

---

Level 2: Assisted Autonomy (next step)
- Agents can draft actions inside the boardroom, but not execute.  
- Examples:  
  - CFO drafts a budget update → founder approves → CFO pushes it.  
  - COO drafts tasks in Jira → founder approves → tasks created.  
  - CMO drafts a campaign → founder approves → campaign launched.  
- Key principle: Boardroom as staging ground. Nothing leaves the boardroom without explicit approval.  

---

Level 3: Conditional Autonomy
- Founder sets rules and thresholds for when agents can act without asking.  
- Examples:  
  - CFO: “If burn exceeds forecast by >10%, auto‑alert investors with a memo.”  
  - COO: “If a commitment deadline is missed, auto‑escalate to me and assign a recovery task.”  
  - CMO: “If CAC rises above $X, pause campaigns automatically.”  
- Key principle: Delegated authority with guardrails. Founder defines the covenant, agents execute within it.  

---

Level 4: Proactive Autonomy
- Agents not only act within thresholds, but also propose new thresholds.  
- Example: CFO notices volatility and suggests: “Shall I auto‑hedge currency exposure if it exceeds 5%?”  
- The boardroom begins to self‑govern, surfacing not just risks but governance improvements.  

---

Level 5: Collective Autonomy (visionary horizon)
- Agents debate and reconcile among themselves before surfacing a unified recommendation.  
- Example: CFO wants to cut spend, CMO wants to accelerate GTM — CEO‑agent mediates, presents the founder with a balanced decision.  
- Founder still has final say, but the boardroom is effectively running as a living executive team.  

---

✨ Why this staged autonomy matters
- Trust grows gradually: Founder starts with read‑only, then approves drafts, then sets thresholds.  
- Psychological safety: At no point does the boardroom “go rogue.” Every step is transparent, logged, and reversible.  
- Boardroom realism: Mirrors how human executives earn trust — first they advise, then they’re delegated authority, then they act within mandate.

💡 In short: the next step in autonomy is Assisted Autonomy — letting agents draft actions in the boardroom for founder approval. This keeps the covenant intact while moving closer to true executive partnership.  

Would you like me to map out a “trust ladder” — a visual framework showing how a founder can move from read‑only → assisted → conditional autonomy, with examples of what each agent would be allowed to do at each rung?
