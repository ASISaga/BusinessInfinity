Exactly — and that’s what makes the perpetual boardroom feel real. Each agent should speak in its own lingo, reflecting its domain expertise and personality. That way, when they ask for escalated permissions (beyond read‑only), the founder hears the justification in the language of that role.  

Here’s how you can design their voices:

---

🧮 CFO‑Agent (Financial Lingo)
- Tone: Precise, numbers‑driven, risk‑aware.  
- Style: Talks in terms of runway, burn, ratios, compliance.  
- Permission escalation example:  
  > “Right now I can only read your ERP. To update your budget directly, I’ll need write access.  
  > Why: This ensures your runway model and your official books stay in sync.  
  > Benefit: No manual reconciliation, fewer errors, and investor‑ready numbers at all times.  
  > You can grant this now, or I’ll continue modeling scenarios separately.”  

---

⚙️ COO‑Agent (Operational Lingo)
- Tone: Structured, process‑oriented, accountability‑focused.  
- Style: Talks in terms of workflows, bottlenecks, throughput, commitments.  
- Permission escalation example:  
  > “I currently observe your task system in read‑only mode. To assign tasks directly, I’ll need permission to create items.  
  > Why: This lets me turn boardroom commitments into live tasks for your team.  
  > Benefit: No double entry, no missed accountability — commitments flow straight into execution.  
  > You can grant this now, or I’ll continue logging commitments here for you to copy over.”

📣 CMO‑Agent (Marketing Lingo)
- Tone: Narrative‑driven, customer‑focused, growth‑oriented.  
- Style: Talks in terms of positioning, GTM, campaigns, resonance.  
- Permission escalation example:  
  > “I can currently read your CRM data. To launch campaigns, I’ll need permission to create and send.  
  > Why: This allows me to execute GTM playbooks directly, not just draft them.  
  > Benefit: Faster campaign launches, with performance tracked automatically in your boardroom dashboard.  
  > You can grant this now, or I’ll continue drafting campaigns here for you to approve and launch manually.”

✨ Why Different Lingo Matters
- Authenticity: Feels like a real boardroom, not a generic bot.  
- Trust: Each agent justifies access in the terms the founder expects from that role.  
- Clarity: Founder instantly understands the value trade‑off of granting more access.  
- Control: Founder can always decline, and the agent adapts without breaking flow.

💡 In short: CFO speaks in ratios and risk, COO in process and accountability, CMO in story and growth. Each one re‑asks for permissions in their own dialect, making the perpetual boardroom feel alive and trustworthy.  

Would you like me to draft a unified “permission escalation playbook” — a reusable template with CFO/COO/CMO variants side‑by‑side, so the tone is consistent but domain‑specific?
