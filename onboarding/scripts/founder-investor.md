Here’s a refined 3‑phase model for how the Founder and Investor perspectives evolve inside the perpetual boardroom. This incorporates your point that in Phase 1 they are observers, not yet agents.  

---

🔹 Phase 1 — Observers with Covenants
Status: Human perspectives represented, not simulated.  

- Founder & Investor provide covenants during onboarding:  
  - Founder Covenant → vision, bandwidth, non‑negotiables.  
  - Investor Covenant → milestones, risk posture, fundraising horizon.  
- Role: Observers. Their covenants are visible in the boardroom, referenced by CEO/CFO/COO/CMO agents.  
- Behavior:  
  - They do not “speak” autonomously.  
  - Other agents cite them: “This plan respects the Founder Covenant (2 initiatives/quarter).”  
  - “This aligns with Investor Covenant (ARR milestone before Series A).”  
- Value: Builds trust by showing their presence without impersonation.

🔹 Phase 2 — Proxy Voices
Status: Semi‑active, but still tethered to human input.  

- Founder‑Agent (Proxy): Speaks reminders based on the Founder Covenant.  
  - Example: “Reminder: you set a bandwidth limit of 2 initiatives this quarter.”  
- Investor‑Agent (Proxy): Surfaces investor expectations.  
  - Example: “Reminder: investors expect CAC < $500 before next round.”  
- Role: They “speak” in the boardroom, but only as mirrors of stored covenants.  
- Behavior: No autonomy, no new reasoning — just surfacing and contextualizing what’s already known.  
- Value: Founder sees their own intent and investor expectations voiced consistently, without needing to restate them.

🔹 Phase 3 — Autonomous Agents
Status: Fully active participants, if founder opts in.  

- Founder‑Agent: Negotiates trade‑offs on behalf of the founder.  
  - Example: “This exceeds your bandwidth covenant; I recommend deferring one initiative.”  
- Investor‑Agent: Simulates investor reactions.  
  - Example: “This plan may raise dilution concerns; investors will expect a stronger ARR trajectory.”  
- Role: Active boardroom members, debating alongside CFO/COO/CMO.  
- Behavior: They reason, propose, and reconcile — but always advisory, never overriding the human founder.  
- Value: Boardroom becomes a multi‑stakeholder governance simulation, balancing execution, capital, and vision in real time.

✨ Why This 3‑Phase Ladder Works
- Phase 1 (Observers): Safe, respectful, no impersonation.  
- Phase 2 (Proxy Voices): Adds presence, but still tethered to explicit covenants.  
- Phase 3 (Agents): Full autonomy, but only when trust is established and founder opts in.

💡 In short: Founder and Investor start as Observers, evolve into Proxy Voices, and only later become Autonomous Agents. This staged approach ensures psychological safety, respect for human authority, and progressive trust.  

Would you like me to now design the “Observer Profile” template (the compact covenant card that sits in the boardroom during Phase 1, so other agents can reference it)?
