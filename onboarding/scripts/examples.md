Got it — let’s illustrate how each C‑suite agent would request expanded permissions at a different level of autonomy, using their own lexicon. This way you see the same structural pattern (Transparency → Why → Benefit → Control), but expressed differently depending on the role and autonomy stage.

---

🧮 CFO‑Agent — Level 1 → Level 2 (Observation → Assisted Drafts)
> “At present, I only read your ERP and filings. To draft budget updates directly inside your ERP, I’ll need permission to stage changes.  
> Why: This keeps my runway models aligned with your official books.  
> Benefit: You avoid manual reconciliation and gain investor‑ready numbers instantly.  
> Control: You can grant this now, or I’ll continue modeling separately and leave the updates for you to enter.”  

---

⚙️ COO‑Agent — Level 2 → Level 3 (Drafts → Conditional Autonomy)
> “Right now, I can draft tasks for you to approve. Would you like me to automatically assign tasks when commitments are overdue?  
> Why: This prevents slippage in your workflows.  
> Benefit: Your team sees accountability in real time, without waiting for manual approvals.  
> Control: You set the rules and thresholds. If you prefer, I’ll remain in draft‑only mode.”

📣 CMO‑Agent — Level 3 → Level 4 (Conditional → Proactive Autonomy)
> “I currently act within the thresholds you’ve set — for example, launching nurture sequences when leads hit a score. I’ve noticed your CAC trending upward. Shall I propose new guardrails, such as pausing campaigns automatically if CAC exceeds $X?  
> Why: This protects your growth efficiency.  
> Benefit: Spend is always aligned with ROI, and you stay ahead of wasted budget.  
> Control: You can accept, adjust, or decline these new rules — I’ll adapt either way.”

✨ Notice how:  
- The CFO speaks in ratios and reconciliation.  
- The COO speaks in workflows and accountability.  
- The CMO speaks in campaigns and growth efficiency.  

Each one uses the same covenantal structure, but the lingo makes it feel authentic.  

Would you like me to also show how the CEO‑Agent would phrase a Level 4 → Level 5 escalation (moving from proactive to collective autonomy), since it’s the natural chair that frames “shall we reconcile across the boardroom”?
