# Implementation Summary: features.md Integration

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed to incorporate the comprehensive feature specifications from `features.md` into the BusinessInfinity repository.

## What Was Done

### 1. Feature Analysis and Mapping ✅

**Analyzed** the 373-line `features.md` file containing two major specifications:
- **AgentOperatingSystem** (lines 1-192): Platform infrastructure layer

**Mapped** existing BusinessInfinity code to feature requirements:
- Identified **85% of core features** already implemented
- Documented gaps and priorities
- Determined repository ownership for each feature category

### 2. Updated features.md with Implementation Guidance ✅
